When I was at Carleton, one of the big priorities of environmental activist students was to move the college over to wind energy-- which has, to a large extent, happened.

There is a sense in which they are formally required to listen only to arguments about charity that are about being \"heartwarming\", not about being efficient.\u00a0</p>", 1341595171], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1341606242207", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109502185221418876252\">Allison</a>\n\u00a0In cases where it's cheaper they should clearly do it, and in cases where it is only very slightly more expensive it could still be worth it. \u00a0But putting up wind turbines is not only a big investment, it's not something the college has much experience with. \u00a0It also surprises me that the college is able to generate wind power more cheaply than a wind farm. \u00a0(When they say \"it's cheaper\" did they include the salaries+benefits of the employees that would be managing it? \u00a0That they couldn't use the land for other things?
