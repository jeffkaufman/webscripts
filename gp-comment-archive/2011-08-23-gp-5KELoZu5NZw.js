[["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1314137997778", "<p>That's the basic problem with learning any new way to do something when you already have a pretty good way: If you can't pretty quickly get at least as good with the new way as you were with the old way, it's hard to keep at it. I had this problem with Dvorak, which I gather is a superior key layout to QWERTY, but after a few days of trying Dvorak, I was only a third as fast as I was with QWERTY, and it wasn't clear that more practice was going to help fast enough. I wasn't willing to give up four to six weeks to gain a small hypothetical benefit. Should I have been? Maybe; hard to say.\n<br>\n<br>\nHope this works out! I'd be curious to hear more.</p>", 1314137997], ["Ivan", "https://plus.google.com/101147004225363019038", "gp-1314215539918", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216\">Josh</a>\n:\n<br>\n<br>\nfrom my own experience, yes, Dvorak is definitely worth investing the month or so that it takes to become proficient.  the benefit is very clear to me whenever i find myself forced to revert to Qwerty.  not because my Qwerty proficiency has regressed much, but because Qwerty feels really awkward, forcing me to contort my fingers to reach common keys.  using Dvorak, i feel like i hardly ever use the bottom row, and most of my keystrokes are on the home row.\n<br>\n<br>\nif you ever reconsider learning Dvorak and you're also a programmer (or otherwise use symbols frequently), check out Programmer Dvorak &lt;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard#Programmer_Dvorak\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard#Programmer_Dvorak</a>\n&gt;.  it really doesn't make sense to be forced use Shift so much just because you write a lot of code.</p>", 1314215539]]
