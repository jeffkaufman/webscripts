Some questions about this analysis, which may be unanswerable:\n<br>\n<br>\n1. If most Somerville lots are already nonconforming, are they nonconforming by enough to make 0.75 the wrong factor to use in your price prediction?\n<br>\n<br>\n2. Aren't you assuming that your new zoning rules are permissive enough to clear the market?  Personally, I bet that would happen in some but not all parts of Somerville.\n<br>\n<br>\n3. Will a significantly denser Somerville need more land-consuming infrastructure of other kinds - grocery stores, laundromats, schools, restaurants, bars, whatever?  If so, that complicates the zoning change and cuts into the land use ratios.\n<br>\n<br>\n4. To what extent are there network effects, i.e. does densifying Somerville increase intrinsic demand for Somerville?</p>", 1525177401], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1525186950951", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481\">David&nbsp;German</a>\n 1: Surprisingly enough, 0.75 is the mean FAR for RA/RB in Somerville.  \n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ra-rb-report-final-web.pdf\">https://www.jefftk.com/ra-rb-report-final-web.pdf</a>\n has \"the RA and RB districts have a mean FAR\n<br>\nof .72 and .78 respectively\" and taking a weighted average by the number of lots in each you get 0.752 FAR.
