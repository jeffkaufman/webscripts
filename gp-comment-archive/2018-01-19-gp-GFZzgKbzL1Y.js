(Please note: \"most likely\", not \"worst\".)  North Korea's arsenal is still small, inaccurate, and low-yielding, which makes initial survival a lot more likely, and the requirement to deal with two weeks of fallout much more pressing.  For where you live, your neighborhood isn't even central enough to be deliberately targeted, and your city isn't even important enough to be targeted yet (neither is mine).
