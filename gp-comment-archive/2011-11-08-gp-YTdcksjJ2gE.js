If not, why not, from an outcomes-based standpoint?\"\n<br>\n<br>\nBill Gates is probably not a good example here, because dissuading him from continuing to give away lots of money would have bad outcomes.  Your argument still applies if we take some other very rich person who does not engage in philanthropy.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are probably other options for you person than theft.  You could go to a soup kitchen, dumpster dive at grocery stores, or possibly even go to the emergency room.  For thought experiment purposes, though, we should probably be assuming you really have no other options.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe're trying to balance the harm caused by the theft against the harm of you starving to death.  Starving to death is pretty bad, so a first look at outcomes would say that the rich person is hurt far less than you gain.  You're only gaining one meal, though, which probably lasts at most two days, so the benefit isn't \"you live another 60 years\" but \"you live another two days\".  That brings the harm of starvation down a lot.  The negative effects of the theft are also greater than the cost of the food you take.  It's unpleasant to be robbed, and perhaps the experience causes this person to tell their friends and they all install expensive security systems, which is basically wasted money.\n<br>\n<br>\nI think neither of these is an overwhelmingly better outcome, but the stealing probably wins.
