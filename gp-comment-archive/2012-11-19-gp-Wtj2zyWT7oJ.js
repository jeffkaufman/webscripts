Useful for other board members and whoever does the booking for future dances. \u00a0A particular point would be how well they did in teaching beginners. Was it too much talking and not enough trying and demoing? (We had a recent JP dance with a well-known good caller who didn't deal well with beginners). Board members in charge may need to give advice to the caller about how much teaching should be done).\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nAnother question would be how public such reports should be.</p>", 1353365756]]
