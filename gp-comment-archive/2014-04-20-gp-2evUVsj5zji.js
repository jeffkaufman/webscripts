A vegetarian/vegan can not support the farms that are treating animals well, thereby reducing the suffering of animals while not eliminating the suffering. Given that most of our population is not going to be vegetarian or vegan, Which is better? Supporting farms that treat animals well, so the animals have good lives and do not live in a dark box standing in their own refuse, or boycotting animal farms entirely?\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is not clear cut issue.</p>", 1398034493], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1398035143993", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111048496655804586662\">Harriet</a>\n\u00a0\"Honey is definitely NOT vegan\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm sorry, I wasn't trying to say it was. \u00a0I was saying that food grown with saturation pollination probably involves more bee-suffering than honey, but that food is vegan and honey isn't.</p>", 1398035143], ["Chris", "https://plus.google.com/112938759017605010116", "gp-1398036736550", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111048496655804586662\">Harriet</a>\n\u00a0\"No vegan I know eats honey.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm a vegan who eats honey, for the reasons Jeff mentioned (as well as a relative disregard of insect suffering), and last time I polled my vegan friends most of them were unbothered by honey too.\n<br>\n<br>\nAn attempt at minimizing animal suffering would have to start by making some assumption about how much different animals are capable of suffering in the first place, and I expect bees would not be given much capability -- you might end up worrying more, for instance, about mice killed during crop harvesting. \u00a0But ultimately you have to pick \nsomething\n to eat, of course.\n<br>\n<br>\nHere's the best (only?) page I've found attempting to rank suffering options: \u00a0\n<a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html\">http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-per-kg.html</a>\n<br>\n<br>\nIt claims that by weight, eggs cause 50x more suffering than beef and 850x more than milk. \u00a0Cows are pretty efficient!</p>", 1398036736], ["Brad", "https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302", "gp-1398119518256", "<p>\"If you think that animals in the wild generally have good lives then this is a bad thing, but if you think the typical life of a wild animal is mostly suffering then this habitat destruction is probably beneficial on balance and should be counted in the favor of the food in question.\"\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nI know Brian Tomasik has written about wild animal suffering and he thinks most wild animals' lives are not worth living, but his arguments seem to assume that animals spend most of their time dying, being hunted, starving, or being slowly consumed by parasites. Biologists who study time budgeting (how animals actually spend their time) would have a very different view. Many birds, for example spend 40% or more of their time resting. Much of the remaining time is spent foraging, defending their territories, or sleeping. You don't see these activities in nature films on television, because it's boring. You see animals being hunted down and killed, sometimes brutally. Animals die just once: if they suffer terribly during death does that mean they lived lives of suffering? I've spent a lot of time following animals (mostly birds) and recording their behavior, and I haven't seen much in the way of suffering.\n<br>\n<br>\nI think, as with humans, the degree to which an animal lives a life of suffering depends strongly on the ndividual and the location in which it lives. Animals in areas prone to droughts or floods may suffer more than animals in nutrient-rich, mild-climate areas. The argument that we should feel okay about destroying the habitat of future generations of animals makes it sounds like we should feel equally fine if we were to destroy farmland and villages in developing countries, because so many people in developing countries \"live lives of suffering\" that we'd reduce suffering if we make it impossible for future generations to be born and live in developing countries.</p>", 1398119518]]
