Before my launch, a site with ads switching to HTTPS would probably lose a lot of money, because many ads were HTTP-only and would stop serving.  We fixed that by forcing all ads to be secure, \neven on insecure sites,\n so that ads revenue would no longer be a disincentive for HTTPS migration.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+MichaelKleber/posts/MQwm48RviGc\">https://plus.google.com/+MichaelKleber/posts/MQwm48RviGc</a></p>", 1520823185]]
