That not only gets you World War 2, it gets you things like the Persian Gulf war.\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, in that sense, the Allies \ndid\n have a choice, at least initially. Britain and France weren't forced to go to war with Germany when they did, although Germany may well have attacked them later. Likewise, the US wasn't forced to go to war with Germany when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. And surrender is always an option as well.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you merely want to say that no one should ever \nstart\n a war, then you're not saying very much about the morality of military service and conscientious objector status. In the US, you cannot claim CO status on a case-by-case basis. Admittedly, I don't support that law, but from a practical standpoint, if you would be morally obligated to serve if drafted in a WW2 scenario, then you can't claim CO status, regardless of how you might react to the Iraq War.\n<br>\n<br>\nMoreover, having said all that, I also think that the claim that there is no such thing as a good offensive war is probably also too strong. It might be difficult or even impossible to identify in advance, and in the vast majority of cases I'm sure I'd be opposed. But, for example, I think we can safely conclude that if the Allies had decided to pre-emptively invade Germany and oust Hilter before his military buildup (say in the early to mid '30s), the world would have been better off.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnother (arguably) offensive war that a large number of people would say was beneficial was the American Civil War.
