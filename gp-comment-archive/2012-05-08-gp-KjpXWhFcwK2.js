[["Rebecca", "https://plus.google.com/108076092316272654620", "gp-1336488063710", "<p>One explanation I've heard for some contra dances developing a gender-imbalance with more men is that a small minority of regulars at the dance are \"creepy\" men (especially older ones) who \"scare off\" new female dancers (especially younger ones). While I think that there are in truth very, very few men at contra dances who actually act inappropriately, new dancers can be disconcerted by even well-meaning friendliness and eye contact, perceiving it as \"creepy.\" I don't know how big a factor this actually is, but it seems reasonable to me that new female dancers might be more sensitive to this than new male dancers. I've certainly brought female friends contra dancing who chose not to return because of this. \n<br>\n<br>\nThis problem is self-reinforcing. The more unbalanced a dance becomes, the more in-demand female dancers are, and the harder men need to work to find partners. As a female dancer at a severely unbalanced dance, I find it overwhelming and uncomfortable to be literally swarmed by multiple men asking me to dance, or to have to turn down a half-dozen booking requests during a single dance, or to have men get annoyed at me for sitting out or for dancing with a female friend. I am therefore less likely to return to that dance, further worsening the gender imbalance. \n<br>\n<br>\nI agree that encouraging more dancers to swap roles (voluntarily, not just out of desperation) is a great way to break the cycle.</p>", 1336488063], ["Katherine", "https://plus.google.com/111274538329832838041", "gp-1336505484608", "<p>I learned to contra dance here at Swat, where a fair number of dancers are comfortable dancing both roles and where booking is generally avoided. When I was fairly new to dancing, I would go to Glen Echo when I was home on breaks (and I would enjoy myself), but I've stopped doing so because of the gender imbalance. There are more men there and almost none of them will dance with each other; I find that I dislike what this does to the culture of the dance.\n<br>\n<br>\nAlthough I was taught very strongly to not book dances, I think that I would be much more likely to dance somewhere like Glen Echo if I went with a group of friends that I could book dances with. That way I could guarantee that I would enjoy a certain number of dances, while  also spending some time dancing with new partners.</p>", 1336505484], ["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1336526053151", "<p>Huh: We had heard that the Boston Playford Ball was still gender-balanced, thought this was ridiculous, and asked about it, and were emphatically informed that it was not, and hadn't been for a while, which we were happy to hear.

I don't think I would go back often to a contra where I was expected not to dance with a woman while men were sitting out. It is, for me, disconcerting enough that these men all \nare\n sitting out by choice; it is very weird that anyone would think I should not dance with my choice of partners so that they would have access to \ntheir\n choice of partners. Well, okay, not so much weird as predictably sexist and heteronormative. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI generally prefer dancing with women, and dancing the lead role, though over time I have gotten better at following and therefore less averse to it. It would be really difficult, socially, for me to go to a \"regular\" contra and only dance in my preferred role with my preferred gender of partner. People would think I was being quite rude, to decline partners and then dance with other people, or I would have to do a lot of booking even at dances where there is generally little booking. So it's disconcerting that straighter and more gender normative people get so much support for their preferences, even at the cost of interfering with who other people can dance with.</p>", 1336674579]]
