Right of way notwithstanding, that stretch of Rt 16 is not at all safe for bikes, unless they take the full lane, which would have a crushingly disruptive effect on traffic if it were significantly used by bikes. I very much believe that bikes have a right to use the road, but there just isn't enough road there. (So maybe \"well, sucks to be a car, then\" is the right answer, but it would \nsuck\n.)\n<br>\n<br>\nConversely, that stretch may be the road with the highest ratio of \"times I've been on it\" to \"times I've seen bikes on it\". Seldom if ever. Which you could take to mean \"no one wants to ride bikes there anyway, so who cares if they're banned\", or \"...so why bother banning them\". But in fact it's a terrible dangerous place to ride, signs or no.\n<br>\n<br>\n(I do applaud your efforts to make sure bikes don't get screwed over, contrary to the law, FWIW. I just think this particular case is legitimately unusual.)</p>", 1347505999], ["BDan", "https://plus.google.com/103775592027106438640", "gp-1347630623616", "<p>I have ridden the new path, and it is awesome.
