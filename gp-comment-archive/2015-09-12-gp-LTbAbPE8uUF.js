The business trips cost them nothing at all, and the miles pay for their families' vacations as an untaxed benefit. With current technologies (skype and better), many business trips -- and many academic trips -- could easily be replaced by virtual meetings. But people are very concerned to maintain their \"elite status\" and perks and mileage bonuses, so they go on flying. Evidence is anecdotal (overhearing flier talk), but I am sure the airlines have done precise marketing research.\u00a0</p>", 1444873885]]
