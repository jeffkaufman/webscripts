One clarification: the vast majority of patients on our website have not yet received care. In fact, we've rarely (if ever) received a treatment update before the patient's care was funded on the website. And because we require that our hospitals submit profiles before the patient receives care, we're never approving treatments retroactively.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis is similar to how healthcare works in the US, for example. When you go to a hospital for surgery, they don't ask you to pay upfront. Instead, they ask you to make a commitment to pay, and then they bill you immediately after the treatment happens, which makes a lot more sense when you think about the intricacies of medical care (e.g. it's hard to predict if a patient will need one pint of blood or two, hard to predict complications, it's immoral to withhold care and endanger the patient, etc.).</p>", 1378577638]]
