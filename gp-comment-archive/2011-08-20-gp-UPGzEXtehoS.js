This has happened to me - and I tried to argue with the doctor, but she wouldn't listen.  Additionally, sometimes the drugs are prescribed prophylactically - hoping to prevent the onset of a possible bacterial infection (ie. preventing the development of bacterial pneumonia after fighting off a persistent cold, which is viral in nature).  I haven't decided yet if I agree with the use of antibiotics prophylactically.  I think it might depend on how healthy, or at risk, the patient is for developing the possible bacterial infection.  Any thoughts on that?\n<br>\n<br>\nYou point out that patients not being strict with their antibiotic regiments can lead to the spread of resistant bacteria to other people.  It's also important to note that that infected individual may ALSO become ill again.  Clostridium difficile is a great example of this.  Although, part of the reason C. difficile can survive antibiotic treatment is its ability to form spores, which is not an transferrable resistance marker.  \n<br>\n<br>\n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066\">Todd</a>\n  I think that you raise a good point.  If we were to stop using certain antibiotics, it is possible that the genes encoding antibiotic resistance would be lost when the pressure to keep them around was removed.  However, the genes for antibiotic resistance have been around since well before we started using antibiotics - they are a natural defense mechanism against bacteria/fungus that secrete the antibacterial toxins.  So, they aren't going to disappear completely. \n<br>\n<br>\nI don't have any concept of how long we would have to stop using a particular antibiotic in order to allow for a drastic reduction of the resistance genes in the bacterial population.  Additionally, we've reached a point where bacteria have started to utilize resistance mechanisms that protect them from more than one type of antibiotic - these are mainly pumps that pump the drugs out the bacterial cells before they can function.  Therefore, I think we would have to stop use of ALL antibiotics in order to decrease the percentage of resistant bacteria - and that just isn't practical.</p>", 1313959969], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1314032440813", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104890942592036978223\">EmilyKate</a>\n \"I think we would have to stop use of ALL antibiotics in order to decrease the percentage of resistant bacteria\"\n<br>\n<br>\nWouldn't it be possible to stop using a type of antibiotic, if the issue is that bacteria are adapting to a specific type?\n<br>\n<br>\nWe might be unlucky, however, and find that general antibiotic resistance is also a (very minor) survival advantage for bacteria, helping them against fungi or something.

However, if the resistance gene is maintained on a plasmid (extrachromosomal DNA), it will quickly be lost.  It takes a lot of energy to maintain a plasmid, and because of that it is disadvantageous to a bacterium to keep it around unless there is pressure to do so.  We see this phenomenon quite frequently in lab...\n<br>\n<br>\nHOWEVER, I do stand by what I said before, that we would have to stop use of all antibiotics...  Yes, \n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008\">Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman</a>\n , it is true that there are different types of antibiotics - and some resistance genes only provide resistance to certain types or classes of antibiotics.  However, there are some resistance genes that work against many types/classes of drugs...mainly pumps.</p>", 1314047124]]
