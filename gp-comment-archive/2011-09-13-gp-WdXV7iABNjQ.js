I was thinking that we could use a good multi-caller dance around here.  Either something like Nelson where one person calls the first half and the second half is 1 dancer per caller, or if there's enough callers interested, we could do multi-caller the whole night.  Having a weekly dance like this would be an amazing place for new callers to get experience.\n<br>\n<br>\nI've been thinking about this for a long time and would love to do it as a donation run volunteer effort, but that would require a) finding volunteer musicians and b) finding a really cheap hall.  I don't know how hard the first one would be, but the second sounds really tough.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I'm very interested in helping with a project like this if it has a multi-caller aspect.\n<br>\n<br>\nMy only thoughts about good, affordable dance spaces are if we can find a university with a good floor and some students at that university that would like to be a part of such a project.</p>", 1315930860], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1315931899958", "<p>@Chris: I do think some sort of multicaller thing could be interesting.

I think that there are so many callers that are interested in calling that getting multiple volunteer callers should be easy.  The only issue I can think of is that hiring well known callers might get more people who already contra dance to come, but I don't think it'll affect the core target which is people who live on public transit and thus can't make it to places a bit further out.</p>", 1315936565], ["Rebecca", "https://plus.google.com/108076092316272654620", "gp-1315947194167", "<p>@Chris: This hypothetical weekly dance could do what Glenside, PA does: they hire individual (sometimes big-name, sometimes not) callers for most weeks and then sometimes--perhaps once a month--hire a \"coordinating caller\" (usually for a reduced fee) who is responsible for organizing the calling for the evening, recruiting volunteer callers and calling some dances to fill in the gaps.

A regular dance is a LOT of work, especially a weekly one; you have to constantly be booking bands and callers, and don't expect too many of them to be willing to work for free.  Once or twice, maybe, to help get the dance going, but you need well known musicians and callers to draw folks in.</p>", 1315956105]]
