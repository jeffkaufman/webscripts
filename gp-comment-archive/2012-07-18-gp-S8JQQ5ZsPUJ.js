In that case, a lower interest rate leads to more total savings required, and, that could possibly lead to larger near term savings. (it might depend on the utility function of consumption as to whether the increase in total savings was front-loaded or backloaded). One could, of course, argue that a target retirement total is not the right way to optimize life, but I believe many people do approach retirement in that way.</p>", 1342635393], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1342636544845", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111675838261170541573\">Marcus</a>\n\u00a0That sounds plausible enough to me that someone might reason that way. \u00a0Target retirement is not absurd: maybe I want to live in a retirement community that costs about X, so figure out how much I would have to save to make that likely.</p>", 1342636544], ["BDan", "https://plus.google.com/103775592027106438640", "gp-1342662524230", "<p>Of course, one of the big issues is that word \"expect\".\u00a0 I think it's very difficult to say at this point whether interest rates over the next 40 years will be anything like those of the past 40.</p>", 1342662524], ["David&nbsp;German", "https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481", "gp-1342671046850", "<p>TL;DR: For most savers in the US, tax incentives are more important. \u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nIt's standard advice to do the following steps annually, in order of priority, so far as you can afford them. \u00a0Numbers are 2012 contribution limits for a single taxpayer with earned income.\n<br>\n<br>\n1. Save enough in a 401(k) or 403(b) to capture your entire employer match, if any.\n<br>\n2. Save $5,000 in an IRA.\n<br>\n3. If you have a high-deductible health plan, save $3,100 in an HSA. \u00a0Do not use this money to pay your medical bills if you can avoid it.\n<br>\n4. Continue saving in the 401(k)/403(b) until you hit the $17,000 maximum.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn total, you can transfer $22-25k/year [1] plus employer match into tax-advantaged vehicles.
