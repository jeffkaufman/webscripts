For example, in (9)4, the first digit past the decimal is 9, the second is nine, and for any natural number n, digit n after the decimal place is 9. However, digit \u03c9 after the decimal is 4, digit \u03c9 + 1 is 0 (by axiom 4), and all subsequent digits after the decimal are also 0.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter the first so in your proof, you say\n<br>\n<br>\n(x)x = (x) by #1.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis is false, and does not follow from before. Consider the example of x = 9. The part before the \u201cso\u201d has been dealing with ((9)9) = ((9)). With just the first repetition, this means that for all natural numbers n, the nth digit after the decimal is 9. Adding the second, we get that for all n and m, digit \u03c9\u00b7n+m is nine. However, digits \u03c9\u00b2 and beyond are all zero (which is why ((9)) &lt; ((9))1). Next, you try to use property #1 to get that (9)9 = (9). But this doesn\u2019t work: in the former, digit \u03c9 is 9, while in the latter it\u2019s 0.\n<br>\n<br>\nI believe this is related to the fact that \u03c9 + 1 &gt; \u03c9, but 1 + \u03c9 = \u03c9. Infinity is counterintuitive; tread with caution.</p>", 1463362628], ["Daniel", "https://plus.google.com/104241554778763268733", "gp-1463362941696", "<p>On an unrelated topic, expand the ASCII-ized notation to include other forms of brackets. Then you could write [(9)9] instead of ((9)9). This helps keep track of which overline you\u2019re representing.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn all examples so far, this doesn\u2019t help, because the overlines have been nested.
