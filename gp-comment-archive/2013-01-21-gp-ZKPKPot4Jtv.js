[["Leland", "https://plus.google.com/114575814092755493073", "gp-1358809175051", "<p>This is an interesting question for me, because I went the other way: By default, I enjoy concerts considerably more than dances and had to actively teach myself to enjoy music via dancing. I seem to lack that \"this makes me want to dance\" impulse: Even very dance-oriented music used to be most accesible to me when I was sitting still.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhich isn't to say that all music is good concert music for me: There is definitely a lot of music (including primarily dance-oriented music) that I enjoy best when I have something else to focus on, like writing, or thinking some problem through. Good concert music, for me, is exactly that music where the music itself provides something to think through, where the effect the music has on me and/or the means by which it accomplishes this is interesting in and of itself. While there is definitely some music played for dances that meets this criterion for me, much of dance-oriented music doesn't. (And, of course, it doesn't need to \u2013 good dance music does not need to also be good concert music.)\n<br>\n<br>\nFor me, this kind of mental engagement with the concert usually takes one of two forms. Sometimes I engage via analysis \u2013 trying to listen carefully enough to hear details of both the sound and the structure. Other times, I engage via empathy \u2013 more or less imagining that I'm a participant in some way. This can be as simple as \"singing along\" in my head, or as complicated as imagining how I would arrange the music for a different ensemble. These tasks give me something for the music to act \non\n, the same way I suspect dancing does for you.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs I said, I had to actively learn to engage with music via dancing, and still can only do it in a fairly limited respect. Movement never feels like the natural response to music for me, so I had to spend a fair amount of time internalizing contra dance figures and understanding how they related to the music before I could really enjoy the experience. (My first few dances were definitely enjoyable only from the intellectual standpoint of learning something new, and it was quite a while before I could enjoy \"easy\" dances that didn't provide that learning curve.) I now do best when I can hit a flow state with my dancing where I don't need to actively think about it at all, and can turn my attention to the music \u2013 in effect letting the dancing influence my perception of the music, and not the other way around.</p>", 1358809175]]
