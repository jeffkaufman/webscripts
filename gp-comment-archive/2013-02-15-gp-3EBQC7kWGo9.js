This would allow one to photograph somebody's sidewalk right after it snows, come back after they've shoveled and photograph it again, and then, after the deadline passes, feed both photos to the camera app (the second at an appropriate delay), and claim credit.

If they own the sidewalk (I assume they don't), then it's theirs to do as they please with. If they don't, they're being asked to take care of someone else's property (the city's, presumably) just because they're close by. We don't expect them to do this with the street, so why should we with the sidewalk?\n<br>\n<br>\nBut even if we just assume property owners ought to be responsible, this still seems like an obviously broken system. I'm normally the last person to advocate an increased role for government, but this seems like a pretty obvious case where it would be beneficial. Relying on individuals has the exact problem that you've witnessed. Some will be ignorant of the law, some will ignore it, some will think it not worth their time and money to arrange something if they are otherwise incapable of clearing the walk.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf, on the other hand, the local government just clears the sidewalk, you don't have to worry about the ridiculous cat-herding problem involved in parceling the responsibility out to property owners.\n<br>\n<br>\nThen there's the question of enforcing the fine, assuming it could be expected to do its job. What sense is there in having the city spend resources to investigate and levy the fine, when it could just spend the resources to directly clear the sidewalks?\n<br>\n<br>\nThe city already does a capable job of clearing the streets. If the sidewalks are important enough to fine people for not clearing, they're important enough for the city to take advantage of its existing snow-clearing infrastructure and clear them directly.
