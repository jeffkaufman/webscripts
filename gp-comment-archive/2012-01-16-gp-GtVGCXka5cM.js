People will generally walk twice as far (.5 mile vs. .25 mile) to a rail transit station than a bus stop.  It's probably accurate to call this snobbery, but it's neither the first nor the last time that popular preferences fail to line up to the engineering optimum.  The popularity disparity can be counteracted by upgrading the bus line, but by the time you've hit parity, you've often spent just as much money as you would have to just build rail (cf. the MBTA Silver Line).</p>", 1326783679], ["b", "https://plus.google.com/109680641548243670506", "gp-1326785361603", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216\">Josh</a>\n : I admit to being one of the people who prefers rail, and it's mainly for a reason that has nothing to do with the intrinsic properties of buses. It's that rail is harder to screw up if you don't already know what you're doing. With rail, they announce the stops, and you pull into a station with big signs saying what stop it is. If you know the easy-to-remember name of the station you're going to, all you have to do is keep that in mind and you're prettymuch okay. With buses, you have to constantly peer out the window to try to suss out whether you're there yet, which is especially tricky in the Boston area, where street signs are not as reliable as in some other parts of the country. There are a number of other issues that are similar in character. If buses had a comparable level of user-friendliness to rail for those of us who didn't already know exactly what we were doing, I'd use them a lot more. I mean, the weekend red line bus replacement we've got right now strikes me as just fine (except for the minor issue with waiting outside in the cold), because it has all of the basic structural and documentation features of a subway line, except it happens to be a bus.

There's also frequency: since most buses run much less frequently than every 10 minutes, I have to pay attention to schedules; real time tracking helps with this a bit, but it's not very accurate, which is why I wound up walking 1.6 miles to Sullivan rather than waiting for the next bus (after the one I missed due to bad data) this weekend, and walked home from it last night because there wasn't even going to be one (out of three possible routes) within the next 25 minutes when I got there.\n<br>\n<br>\nIncidentally, most or all mass transit, both bus and rail, used to be private.

It's not. The subway side is cheaper on labor (one or two operators per train versus one per bus), motive power (electric vs. (usually) diesel), rolling stock (subway trains can and do last 40 years in service whereas buses need overhaul after 10 and replacement after 20), and time (they're faster, so less rolling stock can cover a route at the same service headway).  MBTA charges less for a bus because a bus inferior service, not because it's cheaper to provide.  (Most other agencies figure the factors cancel out and charge the same for both).\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd capacity? Ha ha ha ha no.  The biggest buses the T runs are 60' articulated buses.  Using the newest ones (New Flyer DE60LFRs, for those as care), that gets you a seated capacity of \"up to 64\" per bus (\n<a href=\"http://www.newflyer.com/index/restyled-specifications-printer-friendly\">http://www.newflyer.com/index/restyled-specifications-printer-friendly</a>\n), plus standees (no readily available web source, but I'd be shocked if it were much over 20, so we'll say 40.)  A Red Line 01800 car is 69' long (and a foot wider), runs in trains of up to 6 cars, every 9 minutes at rush hour (more could be run in theory, but we'll ignore that), seats 50 and stands 150 or more (no ready source, but extrapolating from NYC's 60' * 10' subway cars cited at \n<a href=\"http://talk.nycsubway.org/perl/read?subtalk=646248\">http://talk.nycsubway.org/perl/read?subtalk=646248</a>\n ).  To replace the Red Line's current capacity, you would have to run an articulated bus every 47 seconds at rush hour.  I'm fairly certain that this is actually impossible (it's certainly incompatible with any other traffic in the bus lane, and possibly also with crossing traffic or pedestrians).  The Green Line is slightly better; it runs 2-car trains (very rarely, 3) every 6 minutes to Lechmere, but of course only the E branch runs that far, and the other three branches turn back in Boston.  With a passenger capacity of 154-166 per Type 8 car (\n<a href=\"http://www.lightrail.com/carspecpages/mbta/mbtatype8.htm\">http://www.lightrail.com/carspecpages/mbta/mbtatype8.htm</a>\n), that only requires an articulated bus every two minutes or so to match current capacity to Lechmere at rush hour.  The main Tremont/Boylston Green Line trunk would require an articulated bus every 30 seconds.  \n<br>\n<br>\nAnd in all these scenarios, you have maintained theoretical capacity while replacing a popular service with an inferior, less popular, more expensive one, and seriously disrupted the cityscape in doing so.</p>", 1326860170], ["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1326899287841", "<p>Noda: Thanks for the all the info; that's definitely stuff I didn't know.</p>", 1326899287]]
