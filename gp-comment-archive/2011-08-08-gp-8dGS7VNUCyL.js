If we give everybody a voucher that can only be spent on health insurance, and tell would-be insurers that they can only accept the vouchers if they accept them from everybody, then we have a lot less adverse selection and a lot fewer problems from people being uncovered when disaster strikes, and we soften the impact of some people being stuck with more expensive health issues than others.

Signing up for current benefits is difficult or impossible (section 8 housing) or limited to a certain number of months (TANF cash grants).  So by making it easier to get them, we'd dramatically increase how much this would cost.\n<br>\n<br>\n(2) it would decrease people's incentive to work.  Sure, you keep 62 cents of every dollar you earn, but if you expect to get $10K in perpetuity whether you work or not, why work?\n<br>\n<br>\n(3) this is going to require raising taxes on the rich.  As calculated, the top tax bracket goes from 35% to 38%, but because of (1) and (2) it might need to go up even more.  This would reduce the returns to investment and make potentially limit growth.\n<br>\n<br>\n(4) as you said, people might have children for the money.\n<br>\n<br>\nOne potential solution would be lowering the $10K/person to something harder to live on.</p>", 1312922039], ["Sean", "https://plus.google.com/107270646379592003271", "gp-1312986980892", "<p>1)  That's in the short run.  The much more difficult long-run analysis would be to see how much extra GDP is generated by having people with a functional income who are creating more drag via direct payment but much less drag because other factors (health, education, crime) will all go down.  Plus, they would actually be spending money in the economy, which is a good thing.\n<br>\n<br>\n2)  Personally, I feel that we've reached the tipping point past which we cannot maintain full employment at 40 hour work weeks because producing new physical goods is too expensive and we both undervalue and create too many barriers to increasing the amount of non-physical (art, ideas, etc.) goods.  I don't have good evidence to back this up, but I submit that productivity per hour is skyrocketing, while payrolls remain stagnant.  We're back to pre-recession outputs but not to pre-recession employment.  This trend is only going to continue.  Look at Foxxconn in China.  Also, giving people incentive to work is more than about returns; it's about giving them a framework where they can produce something of value to society in exchange for compensation.  It does not necessarily mean washing dishers for 30 years.  This problem is more with the expectations of the haves than it is with the values of the have-nots.\n<br>\n<br>\n3)  Good.  The economy only works when money circulates, and right now the rich have been engaged in mass reduction monies in circulation for 40 years.  They prefer to hoard than spend.\n<br>\n<br>\nSide note: being rich and being poor; if we accept (and I do) prior arguments, then at both ends of the spectrum, you're incentivized to make short term decisions over long.\n<br>\n<br>\n4)  Yeah, so this one is actually a problem.  I'd say just do diminishing returns on each child.  10k for the first, minus 10% for each follow-on.  You'd never reach zero, but you'd make it harder fast.</p>", 1312986980]]
