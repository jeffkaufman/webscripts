But in the same neighborhood, the pedestrianization of Broadway between 47th and 42nd and again at 35th through 32nd actually sped up traffic through Midtown, both by removing redundant vectors in the graph and by eliminating complex six-point intersections at Times and Herald Squares.  But the real gains to be made are going to come from highway removal, not street closure.
