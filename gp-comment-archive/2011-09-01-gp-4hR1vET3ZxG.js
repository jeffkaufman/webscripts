The squaring penalizes outliers extra, because with a normal distribution, outliers are assumed to be very unlikely.</p>", 1314921491], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1314930955351", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475\">David&nbsp;Chudzicki</a>\n \"median minimizes the sum of the absolute values of the differences\"\n<br>\n<br>\nReally?

So if you're trying to minimize the sum of the distances, moving either left or right will help, \nunless\n you have equal numbers of points on both sides.  (So if you have an even number of points, anywhere in the middle of the middle to points is equally good. By convention, I guess we adopt the midpoint between them.)</p>", 1314932141], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1314932409032", "<p>On the original question, it probably works better to ask \"Why is variance a good concept?\" The answer will have to do with all sorts of nice mathematical properties. And then we often take the square root, to have something that's in the same units as what we originally cared about.\n<br>\n<br>\nBut I'll admit that your suggestions might be more intuitive/useful for some of the applications that we use standard deviations for...\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, note that variance and standard deviation are, to statisticians, more naturally properties of probability distributions than a set of points. (Your concept could be defined that we too.) We're often trying to estimate the variance of a distribution from a finite sample.</p>", 1314932409]]
