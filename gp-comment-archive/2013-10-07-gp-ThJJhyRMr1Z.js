I've danced infrequently enough that I'm always an inept beginner, and my sense of it was always that I was looking to other dancers for help, not the caller. And I usually did get that help. I don't know if I was thinking about it this way, but I doubt I'd have wanted the caller to sacrifice fun for everyone else just for my sake (it would depend on the experienced/beginner ration of course).</p>", 1381152900], ["Yoyo", "https://plus.google.com/112374925965540306459", "gp-1381208259256", "<p>I find calling can be stressful, although there are ways to mitigate that.

Paying attention to the dancers is critical, but it's not mutually exclusive with having a good time.\n<br>\n<br>\nSome part of it is a gratifying feeling in helping people remember where to go and making it a fun experience for them. That's enjoyable for the caller, yet it still puts the dancers first. Some part of it is letting go, realizing that sometimes there's nothing you can do except wait for confused pairs of couples to move on to new neighbors. Even though how things go is the caller's responsibility, the experienced dancers are (usually) helping every step of the way. Some part of it is just about performing well.</p>", 1381208259]]
