When people are spending their own money to get things for themselves, they're in a good position to evaluate product/service quality and choose between competitors.  There's a market, and it works reasonably well.  When people give their money to charity they don't have this feedback at all: if my donations were being entirely embezzled it wouldn't affect me personally.  I can use Give Well's reviews to find charities that are doing good work, but I really have to go out of my way to do this, and for more researchy charities evaluation is very hard.  Making sure that money being spent on other people's happiness is effective doesn't happen by default and is very difficult.  I see a role for charity in helping people in ways capitalism is poorly suited for, and I think it's not close to filling the possibilities of that role yet, but I actually think if we were to move all the money we currently spend above the subsistence level into charities it wouldn't improve the world.\n<br>\n<br>\nDavid: \"Concentrating wealth by being highly productive is a big part of the Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman plan, right?\"\n<br>\n<br>\nAs in \"earn a lot of money\"?

Risky would mean supporting research, in the form of pilot programs or charity evaluations.
