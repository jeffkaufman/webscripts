So, on the one hand, we should decrease the time we spend doing something unpleasant, but not at the expense of other pleasantries that come with it, either for ourselves or for our families.

Thinking more about choices can actually make people make decisions they are \nless\n happy with later.  The linked lesswrong article describes an experiment where people were asked to choose between a house closer to work and another with a spare bedroom for grandma to stay in when she came to visit.  In actual experience the shorter commute makes people much happier than the spare bedroom.  Mostly because the commute is daily and the extra bedroom only gets properly used a few times a year.  In the case where people thought more about the decision, though, they were more likely to opt for the extra bedroom.  The author of the lesswrong article speculates that this may be because of the availability heuristic: if examples come easily to mind we think a phenomenon is more prevalent [1].  The idea of grandma coming to visit was more positive and just as available as the idea of a shorter commute.  Even though grandma would come visit so much less often than they would be commuting.\n<br>\n<br>\n[1] a classic example is asking one group of people to estimate the percentage of words ending in \"g\", and another group about the ones ending in \"ing\".

It does mean that on average people aren't aware about what they want on certain fronts.  For example, now that I've had this conversation, I'll be more likely to factor commuting into my housing choices.  Is not that the kind of thinking what you want to achieve?
