Any big, centralized collection of peoples' lifelogged audio is a disaster waiting to happen. Imagine the News Corp. voicemail hacking scandal, repeated with lifelogs. Or worse, fully-automated bulk blackmail. I am also deeply uncomfortable with governments having that sort of data, and they'd surely end up with a copy. If an internet server is truly required, then people should either install the software on their own VPS, so that it's spread around and hard to collect in bulk, or encrypted with search and other functions done client-side.</p>", 1325536161], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1325538296197", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106345404829653994850\">James</a>\n Thinking about how to do this with individual users retaining custody of their data.  I think you'd want to run as a native app with the storage and indexing on their machine.  You could do encrypted backups to the cloud or not.  You have all the headaches of native apps, including developing for windows and dealing with updating.  It's also somewhat cheaper for ongoing costs because you don't need to deal with the bandwidth or the storage.\n<br>\n<br>\nTo deal with users who can't afford to spare 53GB per year of use you could do something like indexing new data on arrival, and archiving old data (with encryption) remotely.  Indexes/transcripts could stay on their computer.  As you updated your indexing algorithms you'd need some way to reindex old things.</p>", 1325538296], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1325569455382", "<p>A lot of people on this thread (here or on Facebook) are worried about privacy. You would always have the option to just not record yourself actively, at least. You might have to be careful about talking to other people who recorded themselves, but there would be no centralized database of your own conversations. I guess the question, though, is how much of a burden it would be to not record yourself if it became pervasive enough. I suspect we'll find out in the not too distant future, whether we want to or not.</p>", 1325569455]]
