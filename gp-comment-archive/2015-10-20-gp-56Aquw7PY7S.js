If so, it's a ridiculous argument.\n<br>\n<br>\nThat $5 you would otherwise spend on milk can't go to charity, it needs to go to some kind of replacement nutrition. Otherwise you could carry this argument further and argue that all your food money should go to charity. After all, even if you die, you might save many more lives.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhat you need to do is keep track of your conditionals. Given that you are going to spend $5 on a healthy beverage, how should you spend it?\u00a0On the one hand you could drink cow's milk, and on the other hand you could drink fortified soy milk.You get similar nutritional value for a similar cost. Which of those two is more harmful?\n<br>\n<br>\nIt's not even a debate. Soy milk is far less harmful.</p>", 1445419476], ["Stephen", "https://plus.google.com/100608437273797315392", "gp-1445427507399", "<p>This is one of the things I don't particularly like about the some aspects of the effective altruism movement.\u00a0 There's this idea that you can take any two actions, compare them based on a \nsingle\n factor, and make a conclusion that one is definitively better than another. This leads groups like 80,000 Hours to make recommendations like encouraging university students to pursue a career in hedge fund management for the sole goal of making wealth available for charitable contributions.\n<br>\n<br>\nThat doesn't consider all factors. In the hedge fund example, 80,000 Hours makes some (but very little) consideration to the harm caused by the particular occupation, and absolutely no considerations about the morality of, to borrow from Bernie Sanders, casino-capitalism.\n<br>\n<br>\nLikewise, there are many, many factors beyond just the immediate impacts of dairy that should be considered. You don't calculate the value of decreasing demand for dairy, certainly the future returns of that are beyond 1/45th of a cow. Non-dairy milks are growing at a phenomenal pace because of the demand vegans have created.\u00a0 Nor does it consider the simplicity of veganism's strictest interpretation of \"avoiding all animal products (as much as possible).\"\u00a0 I think there's a lot of value in not muddying the waters by offering the ability to a person to pay particular harms.\u00a0 Have you done the math for meat? How much does a vegan need to give to a Give Well charity to eat a hamburger?\u00a0 Certainly much higher, but by your logic there must be a price you can pay for it.\n<br>\n<br>\nThen you must consider, if you have the money to pay for the moral costs of meat or dairy, wouldn't it still be better to eat a cheaper plant-based diet and give the available capital from that decision to charities? Surely it would.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd one last thought, your entire premise is rooted in speciesism.\u00a0 The decision to include non-human animals in your moral universe is much bigger than your $5/year cost to eat dairy.\u00a0 The idea of attributing cost to the exploitation of one species by paying for those of our own\u00a0 is speciesist.\u00a0 There is negligible cost to avoiding the exploitation, so it is the right thing to do, no matter how little the relative cost is to you. Would you make an argument about humans? How much would you have to pay to AMF to keep a child slave at home?\n<br>\n<br>\nThe interests of non-human animals must be part of your considerations, which is a much bigger topic than what I wanted to address here, but I think both Peter Singer and Gary Yourofsky are worthwhile to look at for more in-depth discussion of the topic.</p>", 1445427507]]
