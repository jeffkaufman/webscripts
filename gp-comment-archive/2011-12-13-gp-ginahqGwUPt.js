In Pittsburgh, if you move back it can become next to impossible to get off the bus (especially when bus drivers won't open the back door because you're supposed to pay getting off the bus).  When I know I'll be getting off the bus after the crowd thins out, I move back.  When I know I'll have to get off earlier, I first try to let people get by me if possible.  It causes less disruption than spending several minutes making my way back to the front when I want to get off.  I think that the Pittsburgh buses during rush hour are so crowded that people don't really worry about politeness and pushing past people.

People trying to get onto the bus will fill up every available space because they've been waiting for 45 minutes and have seen 5 buses go by without stopping because they are too full.  The bus driver doesn't stop people getting on until there is no space left (never mind about the 'don't stand in front of this line' line).
