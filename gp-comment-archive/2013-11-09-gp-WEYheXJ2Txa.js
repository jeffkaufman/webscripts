(Not as much Scottish, at least in my experience, where a lot of social Scottish dancing in fact happens in the context of a class. Which is fun too, but not quite the same.)</p>", 1384051323], ["Brad", "https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302", "gp-1384081674821", "<p>I do think for contradancing it helps to be able to think clearly in three dimensions and see patterns. I seem to have impediments in that department, as I went to contradances several times a year for 20 years but always stayed at the \"beginner\" level. I needed special lessons from friends outside the context of dances to get the basic skills like how to swing, how to balance, how to do a hay, etc. And I never did get the hang of waltzing, despite lessons from five or six experienced dance teachers (I lived with contradancers) and a two-month formal course in waltz. My joking excuse is that I'm too tall (6'4\") so it takes too long for instructions to travel from my brain to my feet.\n<br>\n<br>\nI play music for dances, and it's interesting to see how skills from one kind of dancing translate or don't translate to other types. We sometimes do Irish ceili dances, contradances, Qu\u00e9becois dances, and Breton dances (from Brittany) in the same evening, and the ceili dancers, Qu\u00e9becois dancers, and contradancers have no trouble shifting among those three styles, but all three groups find Breton dancing very challenging--probably because it involves specific foot patterns and arm movements rather than the sort of group dance patterns you encounter in the other three genres.</p>", 1384081674]]
