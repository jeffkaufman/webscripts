Hopefully we get more callers on the map as a result.\n<br>\n<br>\nEven just with this level, it's interesting to me to see where the difference in local callers compared to local dances (a heat map difference) which would be a good place for an aspiring caller to move to. But it's probably more due to sample size on callers than actual trends (i.e., I'm sure there's are callers in Ohio...)</p>", 1479330996]]
