With earning to give, the work and its direct accomplishments take a back seat; the primary focus is on earning a lot and giving away a high percentage of your earnings. The giving is its own reward, but if you're miserable and mismatched in your career, it's hard to imagine many people who could manage to sustain it for more than a decade.\n<br>\n<br>\nLaw school is hard, demanding work. Being a lawyer is hard, demanding work. You really have to want to do it, because it's going to occupy most of your time, including much of your personal time. I know a fair number of ex-lawyers, including one who decided to work as a carpenter instead. I know there are plenty of examples of people who earn to give, in many professions, but I'd be curious to see follow-up studies over the years to see how many of them managed to stick with it long term. I've actually seen articles by earning-to-givers that start by saying, \"I hate my job, but it allows me to save x lives every year, and that makes me happy.\" Hating your job is a pretty strong demotivator that counterbalances the satisfaction of saving lives. Over time, that demotivator may cause you to question your career choice; it's hard to sustain misery for many years; nobody wants to be miserable for 80,000 hours.\n<br>\n<br>\nOf course the ideal is to choose a career that you feel engaged in AND that earns you a high income so you can give away lots of money. That's in part what 80,000 Hours tries to help people do. I just think it's important for anyone who wants to maximize the good they do to understand that they should balance that desire against the equally important desire to be happy and engaged in their work. Otherwise it's a recipe for burnout and a career change later in life. A person who's engaged and happy in their work but only makes $80K/year could conceivably do more good over their lifetime (because they'll stick with their career) than someone who makes $250K/year but detests their job and leaves or changes careers after 5-10 years.</p>", 1411811638]]
