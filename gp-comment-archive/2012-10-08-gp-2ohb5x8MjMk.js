One of the reasons many people use drugs of various sorts is because they \nlike\n the temporary change in their state of mind. This, for example, is true of me, and determines what situations I'll drink in. When I'm already uncomfortable, it only makes it worse. But if I'm happy and among friends, being somewhat drunk increases my feeling of comfort. It's not a way of thinking I would want to have at all times, just like I wouldn't want to be always getting a thrill from watching a scary movie, but I enjoy both experiences at times. (I should note that I'm not trying to say that getting scared by fiction is anything like as profound a change as getting drunk. But the difference seems to me more one of degree than of kind. After all, it's partly chemicals in my body that give me that thrill, and partly cultural context, and these basic factors are at play with alcohol too.)</p>", 1349711842], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1349760907796", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481\">David&nbsp;German</a>\n\u00a0and I reached a similar conclusion at around the same time.
