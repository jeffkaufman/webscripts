I tried to figure out the formula so I could use it for any substitution (eg, I need to turn 2% milk and heavy cream into half and half) but it involves 2 unknown variables and my math skills are no longer up to the task.  Something like 2(x) + 36(y) = 14 for this example, where x+y=1.  I finally got 65/35, but by arduously plugging in ratios one by one until I got the right result. Could you please share the formula?  Many thanks!</p>", 1494633708]]
