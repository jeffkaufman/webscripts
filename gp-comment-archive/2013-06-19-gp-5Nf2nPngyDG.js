GiveWell does our best to figure out its causal impact on donations. Charity Navigator gets that $10 billion number (roughly) by taking the number of annual unique visitors to its website, dividing by the population of the U.S., and multiplying by total giving in the U.S. Not surprisingly, that leads to far higher results that are much less representative of impact.</p>", 1371691666]]
