I think there's a good general principle for watching the progress of science in here as well: studies as units are subject to variation, noise, sample size, etc., just as much as the data contained within. It seldom makes sense to put much weight on any one study, regardless of topic. Avoid doing that, and you probably avoid the vaccine problem (perhaps not though, I don't know what all motivates people to eschew vaccines).</p>", 1311967366]]
