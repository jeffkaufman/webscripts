I wrote \"don't make as much money as you thought they did, and are generally unhappy\" based on my second hand impression of what julia had found when she looked into it.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs for c (give until it hurts) vs e (give as much as you can) is how far you take it. Under c you stop giving once it hurts. Under e you keep giving past the point of hurt until you're at the bare minimum at which you will be able to keep earning your maximum.</p>", 1312920570], ["Adam&nbsp;Yie", "https://plus.google.com/114873051319510815414", "gp-1312923800070", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008\">Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman</a>\n thanks for the clarification.</p>", 1312923800], ["BDan", "https://plus.google.com/103775592027106438640", "gp-1312988799978", "<p>I think it depends on what branch of law you go into.

This helps with the issue of income disparities in advocacy: It's relatively easy to give 50% if you're making around $75,000 and not supporting a family, but to ask a public-school teacher/parent to emulate your 50% would be asking them to make much greater sacrifices.</p>", 1401478846]]
