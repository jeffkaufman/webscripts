That means a \"free phone\" from T-Mobile costs somewhere between $240 and $480, depending on how often you upgrade it. If you have the financial discipline to manage it, then you are much better off buying a $100 or $200 phone and getting a no-contract plan.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn addition to the money, there are some intangible benefits to bringing your own phone:\n<br>\n- The phone will be unlocked, letting you use it anywhere in the world using a SIM card you get out of a vending machine.\n<br>\n- The phone will have your own software on it, not the company's. If you want to set up a hot spot, it will just work.</p>", 1367859424]]
