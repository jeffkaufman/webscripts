Eventually, when the fund got up to $2500 or so, we stopped doing this (and in the meantime, thanks to various factors, most notably the NEFFA food both, our finances got more stable). We finally got around to buying a new sound system last year.\n<br>\n<br>\n(The original sound system started out as Chris Ricciotti's personal property, which he eventually donated.)\n<br>\n<br>\nIt sounds like you'd like to get a new sound system sooner than a similar scheme would allow (assuming that you're getting enough revenue for it to be possible in the first place).\n<br>\n<br>\nWe don't pay our sound people, other than giving them free admission to a future dance.</p>", 1370617551], ["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1370958104903", "<p>It sounds to me like the savings would be so immediate that a loan would make sense.\n<br>\n<br>\nDo you currently have a \"reserve\" account that you're building up over time?
