Does wanting something make you unhappy? Does getting it make you happy? Maybe in small ways, but probably not in way that like increases the total amount of overall happiness in your life or something.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor example, when you're hungry, and want food, that makes you a little unhappy; and when you eat, that makes you a little happier. But it's not like every time you eat, you get happier and happier and happier, or that someone who's been eating for forty years is happier than someone who's been eating for only twenty.\n<br>\n<br>\nI think other kinds of non-necessities desires are like that too. You want something, which makes you a little unhappy; you get what you want, which makes you a little happy; and then later, you want something else.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis doesn't really get to what was maybe your main point, though, which is that your baseline of what's \"necessary\" rises as you get things that you want, hmm.)</p>", 1344601812], ["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1344601866530", "<p>So perhaps the moral is this: Another way to say \"this new thing is now a necessity for me\" is \"I am now dependent on this thing\", and being dependent on things doesn't make you happy.</p>", 1344601866], ["David&nbsp;German", "https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481", "gp-1344605193734", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008\">Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman</a>\n\u00a0An hour of fulfilling activity doesn't make you detectably happier than an hour of drudgery? \u00a0To each his own, I guess. \u00a0There's no doubt in my mind that time-saving luxuries make \nme\n happier, and basic home electrics save a lot of time rather cheaply.</p>", 1344605193], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1344606451330", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481\">David&nbsp;German</a>\n\u00a0\"An hour of fulfilling activity doesn't make you detectably happier than an hour of drudgery?\"\n<br>\n<br>\nDetectably\u00a0happier right after? \u00a0Probably. \u00a0(Though it would depend partly on whether I was used to the drudgery. \u00a0Washing dishes as routine vs washing dished because the dishwasher is broken.) \u00a0Detectably happier overall in a life with less drudgery, not so sure. \u00a0I think I mostly get used to not having to drudge and it stops having much of an effect.</p>", 1344606451]]
