If this is the case (and I definitely am not well-versed w/ QM), then it's not phenomenologically different from only experiencing it as one me, so it doesn't matter in terms of my own utility. I don't experience increasing utility from the same things as time goes on due to the existence of additional me.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"(My) experience with eating chocolate is that the utility is fleeting.\" Sure, but my point was that each one would get that experience. It doesn't really matter when it happens. In each world, at time t, I ate some chocolate and gained some utility x. So in each world, there is the same net gain in utility, however you want to measure or evaluate that. The fact that each of those worlds might share an identical history up to and beyond time t, and only diverge later, doesn't change the utility calculus.</p>", 1343317400]]
