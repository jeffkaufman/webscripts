Interest rates are practically zero, however, so is there any downside to forcing the government to fund itself through seigniorage instead of bonds?\"\n<br>\n<br>\nHow does printing money have a different bottom-line impact on inflation than issuing bonds? Issuing bonds still increases the effective amount of currency in circulation.\n<br>\n<br>\nMoreover, low interest rates don't change the fact that increasing the money supply means more dollars chasing the same amount of goods &amp; services. You'll still get inflation.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs far as I'm aware, there is no real economic difference between physically printing/minting and issuing electronic paper. It's just which form of abstraction you'd prefer (the electronic version has the advantage of being cheaper, at least).\n<br>\n<br>\nThere may be a legal difference, as you note, but so far as I can tell, that just makes it a bureaucratic/political strategy, not an economic one.</p>", 1355290098]]
