Really, I think the more important thing is that everyone is respectful and welcoming.  If people in the fireplace set are open to newcomers and don't force flourishes and twirls on people just because they ended up in that set, that covers my main concerns.\n<br>\n<br>\nI do believe that dancing with a wide variety of people is important in learning to be a good dancer.  Can a community encourage that while still supporting some age segregation?  The standard (I think it's standard, at least) of only dancing with the same partner once in an evening is a start to that.  \n<br>\n<br>\nI wasn't trying to say that high energy was the same as partner swapping.  Just that both are examples of forming sets with the expectation of a particular dance style.  \n<br>\n<br>\nIt may be that this sort of segregation is more threatening to smaller dance communities.  For instance, the Pittsburgh dance only has two sets and they are generally very well mixed.  I don't think it would work well (or really at all) any other way.

The 'fireplace'(stage left) line at the concord dance I call the 'energetic' line. they might not be the best dancers, but they definitely are the most exuberant. If you want to be exuberant at the expense of complete smoothness or control, that's where you should be. If you're new and you choose the fireplace set (if you can find your partner quick enough) then expect a firmer and faster correction if you are in the wrong spot. this might involve pushing, even though I would frown upon the tactic. I'll usually dance here more of the night than not, but am certainly willing to leave when it becomes too crowded.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe middle line, I call the 'smooth' line. it usually has a good assortment of good dancers, but more focused on sleekly moving through the dance.

I danced here most of the night when I didn't know more younger dancers.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe last line, stage right, is a mixture, I've never found a common current of dancers there, but usually dance there 1-2 times a night just to see what is going on.\n<br>\n<br>\nI do see other dances with separate patterns of lines, but never just based on age - I think that self selection with energy levels and techniques used are completely acceptable. They create their own atmosphere. The issue arises when someone only trained in one line tries to pull the same moves in a different line. You need to align your dancing to the people in that set, or your tone will be off.

Over time, I became more accommodating, trying to predict whether someone would prefer not to twirl, and to notice when people signal they don't like it.  Now my interpretation is closer to that of the older dancers: I think of the twirl as a fun variation.  But the 2006 me that thought of it as the default didn't see it as forcing twirls on people so much as not seeing a point of a boring archaic slow version.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"both are examples of forming sets with the expectation of a particular dance style. \"\n<br>\n<br>\nI misunderstood; that makes sense.</p>", 1325473374], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1325474355089", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/117732328885787456164\">Robert</a>\n For the most part I think it's that you value different things.  Channeling my 2006 self, having enough space to dance was far less important than dancing with friends.

You point out a couple times that you and other teens were/are very reluctant to dance with \"creepy old people\".

Personally I favor dance series where the tendency is to have all people who want to dance dancing, and where an absolute beginner or stranger feels welcome. To this end my first priority in choosing a partner is to see who has been sitting out; these people tend to be beginners or strangers. If there's a gender imbalance in my favor, women will partner up out of necessity (some will do that out of preference as well). In those cases I try to notice which women have been dancing the lead part, and I'll ask a woman who danced the lead to see if she'd like to dance the opposite role. Secondary criteria for choosing a partner are people I haven't danced with before, and friends whom I only see at dances. I refrain from booking ahead so that I'm open to dance with anyone, and I'm always happy to dance with anyone who asks me (though if there are a noticeable number of new people who have been sitting out, I have turned down friends in order to dance with beginners; I've also chosen to sit out rather than have a beginner sit out when there are more men than women.) \n<br>\n<br>\nIf you dance with a large variety of dancers (and I think what I try to do encourages that tendency), then you will be in a position to learn to adapt to all different ages and skill levels. In a thoroughly mixed set, where there are all skill levels and ages, and the dance has a neighbor swing, I find I can always dance however I want if I'm patient enough and sensitive to the level of the person I'm swinging with.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn theory I think age mixing is an ideal, but I agree people should trust their \"creepiness\" instincts and dance with people that make them feel comfortable. \n<br>\n<br>\nI also want to echo Bronwyn's initial comments, which I completely agree with:\n<br>\n<br>\n\"For me it's less an issue of chosen segregation among regular dancers and more an issue of how newcomers (both to dancing and to the particular community) are treated.

Bringing in new people and making them feel welcome is essential.\" \n<br>\n<br>\nYes. Even if there is no conscious exclusion per se, if a person new to a place perceives that there is a \"preferred set,\" then that perception, however unfair, could lead to the feeling of not being entirely welcome.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"Also, just as learning to dance both roles makes someone a better dancer (I believe), learning to adjust one's style to the environment does the same.

Contra dancing is a great place to interact with those who are different from you, even if it's only minimally. I think many of the world's problems exist simply because people don't understand enough about each other. Is contra dancing going to solve the world's problems? No, of course not.
