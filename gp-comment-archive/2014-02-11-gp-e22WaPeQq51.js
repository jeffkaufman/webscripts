When I really need my whistle to be quiet, I play \"air whistle\" by positioning the fipple just under my mouth and blowing over it. You only get one octave and a breathy one at that, but it's good for practicing tunes late at night.\n<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking of whistle tricks, here are two more:\n<br>\n<br>\n1. \"Choke up\" on the whistle by moving all your fingers up one hole, which means your left index finger (if you play right-handed) will not cover a hole but just rest on the barrel. Now play the jig \"Out on the Ocean,\" which is normally in G I think, but it will come out in A.\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\n2. Fill a wine bottle or other equally long bottle with water and insert the barrel end of your whistle in it while blowing, then move the barrel down into the bottle so the fipple approaches the mouth of the bottle. Instant slide whistle, a fun party trick. Also works while swimming in lakes, pools, etc.</p>", 1392222198], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1392226848114", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302\">Brad</a>\n\u00a0\"moving all your fingers up one hole, which means your left index finger (if you play right-handed) will not cover a hole but just rest on the barrel\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThat's actually how I usually play. \u00a0It works fine for a typical D, not well for low whistles, and very well for the high G whistle.</p>", 1392226848]]
