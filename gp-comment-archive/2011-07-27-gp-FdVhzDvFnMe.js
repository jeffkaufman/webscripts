I chose social work because I thought I would burn out at any of the higher-paying options I could think of, but I'm starting to rethink that.

If we could get most americans to do the same, giving 2% to effective charities, the effect would be enormous.\n<br>\n<br>\nI think there are reasons to shoot for less than optimal.  Showing others that you can help people by giving a significant amount of money away without making yourself miserable could be valuable.  Power of a positive example.

So if I choose to be a musician instead of a programmer, and that's a loss of $60K/year in income, the framework tells me that's an equivalent choice to cutting my donations by $60K and remaining a programmer, so I should treat those as equivalent choices.  The not being willing to take the sacrifices to the extreme means I might decide to do this, but that I wouldn't say the musician choice is more acceptable than the \"programmer + lots of spending money\" choice.  Your approach of only sometimes applying the logic doesn't seem to maximize good done for a given level of self sacrifice.\n<br>\n<br>\nI certainly agree that having to think of \"every scone or jar of applesauce as a mosquito net I'm refusing to buy\" is a way to make yourself miserable for very little gain.  It's does poorly on the \"how much good am I doing for the pain I'm causing myself\" metric.</p>", 1312332853], ["Ben", "https://plus.google.com/113533092043162478796", "gp-1312649425265", "<p>I realize I'm a little late on the commenting bandwagon here, but I'd like to add my two cents. While I think that charitable giving is a great way to make use of the money you have and/or earn, I'm not convinced that it's the best system for ensuring a more equal distribution of the world's wealth/resources (assuming something like that is the ultimate goal here). More important, to my mind, is working toward the creation of a global system that promotes social and economic equity, in which \"educated first worlders\" don't have so much more money than anyone else in the first place.</p>", 1312649425], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1312668729166", "<p>@Ben S-H: what would you see as working towards the creation of that sort of global system?\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, while giving does increase equity, increasing equity is not my goal.  I'm ok with there being some very rich people.  I just want there to stop being very poor people.  It may be that increasing wealth is more practical if there are rich people, but increased total wealth means that we can improve the lives of more people.
