Bad point -- historically gendered terms, and certainly not obvious that it is intended to mean current role. (Also the usage is a little different. If a dance temporally puts the person who started as a Beau on the right of their partner, one would say that this person was a Belle until the dance got them proper again. This is useful for talking about dances which have e.g. a Ladies Chain performed by people not in the roles where they start they dance. That's a usage in discussing dances, though; I haven't heard callers make this distinction in real time.)</p>", 1485532371], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1485532768075", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114974464883384990384\">David</a>\n\u00a0Will the callers call to the people currently on the right as \"Belle\" even if they started the dance on the left?</p>", 1485532768], ["Sam", "https://plus.google.com/103975331151018234280", "gp-1500855431677", "<p>Just came across this discussion while doing a google search for \"larks and ravens.\"  I teach a community dance group in Bridgewater, MA, and we have been using color designations--blue for the left side dancer, green for the right side dancer.  The \"B\" for blue, and the \"G\" for green still leads some people to feel the boy/girl aspect of these terms, but it's been working fairly well.  The issue which seems to remain is getting everyone to feel comfortable in either role.  This is not easy for many, including even me when I dance.</p>", 1500855431]]
