I don't dance enough, at least there. You're right that the other benefits of membership don't appeal to me, in the presence of the modern Internet; I don't want a newsletter sent to me, and I don't care one way or the other about a member directory.\n<br>\n<br>\nI also had one year in which I used a membership at the Art Institute of Chicago enough to make it cost effective; as with BACDS, you had to go more often than I normally would. It helped that you could give the membership card to a visiting friend and they could go to the museum without you.</p>", 1366820431], ["Lex", "https://plus.google.com/111102660583646544610", "gp-1366828224829", "<p>In the examples you give, a basic membership looks like a way to make a donation and receive some minor benefits as a result. Contrast to how it would go if you just gave the donation and that was that.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn those same examples, the people who feel that they are part of that organization is much larger than the people who formally pay dues. In my experience, that broader notion of group membership is very much part of how people act nowadays.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs a simple example, just\u00a0look at how people behave with their cell phones when they meet around a restaurant table. If they find someone using the same brand name, they often act like they are long-lost brothers. It's a stronger bond than I saw in Denmark and in Switzerland when foreigners of the same nationality ran into each other.

BSSC, the guys who run the volleyball leagues I play in (and a bunch of other sports besides) charge $25/season more if you're not a member; membership is $55/year (+$10 the first year). I personally play in five to seven leagues per year, so being a member is obviously a huge advantage to me; and almost all of the players on all of my teams are members too, and play in at three leagues a year. But (a) some of them don't (they move, change jobs, go to school, etc), and BSSC gets their $55 anyway; (b) even if BSSC could be getting +$75 from each of them by eliminating membership, having the $55/year guaranteed up front makes their funding smoother.\n<br>\n<br>\nI assume that dance organizations have similar motivation: Selling memberships, rather than just charging more for dances, gives you a steadier income stream.</p>", 1366828652], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1366831964473", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216\">Josh</a>\n\u00a0\"Organizations like membership-based funding because it's steady and consistent\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThis seems like it's bad for the organizations in the long term. \u00a0These organizations are depend on people wanting to come there: a museum with no visitors or a dance with no dancers is dead. \u00a0A decrease in attendance is not something they should be shielded from: it should wake up the people running it so they can figure out what's happening.</p>", 1366831964], ["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1366837282656", "<p>Sure, but this is why memberships that give you a discount on attendance are good, because (a) once someone has one, they're perhaps more likely to attend, now that the cost is lower; (b) they're appealing to people who want to attend. Memberships that give other non-attendance-related perks aren't as useful for either of those things.\n<br>\n<br>\nMemberships that people buy purely out of charity seem in between: You're not going to buy one except to support the activity, but you aren't necessarily planning to participate. But if the activity withers, it seems likely that you'd stop funding it, so they still give the organizers incentive to keep the activity vibrant.\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, if financial problems are the organizers' only signal that attendance is a problem, they're probably already doing something wrong -- I'd expect engaged organizers to have other ways to keep abreast of whether the activity is going well or not. Relatedly, if there are financial problems, having a cushion of membership funding gives the organizers more time to turn things around than they would if they were surviving only on admission revenue. (And if they don't, people won't renew their memberships, so it's not an indefinite pass.)\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can also get some of that by having cash reserves, but those are expensive. Putting it another way, membership is a way to generate cash reserves without actually cutting into your overall bottom line.
