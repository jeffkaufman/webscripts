Generally in these spaces there's agreement that X is very unlikely but would be very bad if it happened.  But there's very little agreement about precisely what those numbers (probabilities, costs) are, and trade off evaluations end up depending heavily on very small differences.  \n<br>\n<br>\nSo people end up making the tradeoff by gut,  with very little ability to make a rigorous argument to someone else with a different gut belief.  So you get different camps, with different opinions.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe spent a session in the CatRisk working group, having read several papers on this, working on frameworks for evaluating this type of risk, and got nowhere.  I'm not sure it's a solvable problem.</p>", 1499095881], ["Nick", "https://plus.google.com/106589318875299120663", "gp-1499129325076", "<p><a href=\"http://modelingtheworld.benjaminrosshoffman.com/my-new-project-model-the-world\">http://modelingtheworld.benjaminrosshoffman.com/my-new-project-model-the-world</a></p>", 1499129325]]
