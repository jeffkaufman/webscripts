When it comes to emergencies, those who have the least latitude to plan for contingencies are often the poorest. The rich have the option to drive to a different store, stockpile ahead of time, etc., while the poor may be constrained by buses or their feet and a smaller apartment with less storage. If I'm poor, I would rather line up early for water if I know I really need it, rather than get to the store and find I can't afford it, or discover that I have to choose water instead of two meals that week. Also keep in mind that, over short time frames, all supply curves are extremely inelastic -- there are only so many freight helicopters and only so much fuel for them, and a billion dollars won't build you a tanker truck in an hour.\n<br>\n<br>\nSold out shows also don't really play well with supply-demand curves. Good shows are often ticketed cheaply and sell out early, but this means that those who get to go are the biggest fans who follow the band most closely, not the fans with the most money. For a contra dance, you could imagine that the most dedicated participants would be the most likely to sign up early.\n<br>\n<br>\nLots of markets work better when lightly constrained, but I think you've picked on a few cases where an efficient market doesn't actually serve society's interests.</p>", 1330456484], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1330456809053", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100936518160252317727\">Alex</a>\n So because our goal is to distribute resources based on need, willingness to wait in lines can be a better proxy for that than willingness to pay high prices?</p>", 1330456809], ["Alex", "https://plus.google.com/100936518160252317727", "gp-1330458190928", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008\">Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman</a>\n yeah, sort of. In the emergency scenario, I like to think of waiting in line more as a form of price discrimination: rich people's time (or more precisely, the time of those who earn more) is worth more money to society than poor people's time. So, a rich person will spend more money to avoid waiting in that line: by planning ahead (which takes time, opportunity costs, and resources), or by spending money in other ways (drive their car to the next town over to find water). The poor person has no other option -- so the good itself is more valuable to them in absolute terms -- but more importantly, their time is relatively cheap, so they will wait for hours if they have to.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor the event ticket, I think you're spot on: willingness to wait, or to go to ticketmaster and click reload repeatedly at 12:00 noon for tickets to be released, is a great proxy for interest in the event, one that's better than willingness to pay.</p>", 1330458190], ["Robert", "https://plus.google.com/117732328885787456164", "gp-1330466423666", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100936518160252317727\">Alex</a>\n : Although a poor person's time may be \"cheap\", it's not necessarily at their disposal; the time they spend waiting on line may well be time that they would otherwise be working, so they're losing wages, or possibly risking losing their job.</p>", 1330466423], ["Alex", "https://plus.google.com/100936518160252317727", "gp-1330467982039", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/117732328885787456164\">Robert</a>\n there's no question it would suck to risk losing your job, and it's worth recognizing that the poorest often have the most inflexible work arrangements.
