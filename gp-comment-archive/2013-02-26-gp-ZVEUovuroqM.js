For the anti-malaria charity GiveWell has already done the work for us and we see that averting a death costs about $1700. \u00a0So if X as you figured it above is much greater than 1, which it is for me, then donating to net distribution is much better.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile people often use \"effective\" as if all charities are either effective or ineffective it's really a continuum. \u00a0And it's a very long continuum. \u00a0If you want to give to two charities that are close together on the continuum instead of just one, then go ahead. \u00a0But if you're comparing charities that are far apart, and you're giving because you want to help people and make the world better, then money you give to the less effective one is nearly wasted when you consider what it could do going to the more effective one.</p>", 1362000216], ["Marcus", "https://plus.google.com/115811589251174483775", "gp-1362006453358", "<p>Jeff, I picked that example because I suspected that it would fail that sort of analysis, but also because it illustrates the moral choices in giving.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are some moral frameworks for charity that put a greater emphasis on ensuring that someone has a fulfilling life, rather than merely ensuring their survival.\u00a0 Maimonides, for example, said that the highest form of charity is giving someone enough that they become self-reliant.\u00a0 Similarly the Talmud has an anecdote about a Rabbi who, upon learning that a recipient of his charity was drinking fine wines, decide to increase his gift. If we apply the same framework to our anti-Malarial work in Malawi, it implies that we should invest in the economy of the country as well, so the children whose lives we save have the opportunity to raise their own children in prosperity, even if that means saving fewer lives overall.\n<br>\n<br>\nEven if you accept that the anti-malaria work is the best use of $2,000, it's not clear that giving the directly to that cause is the best use of the money.\u00a0 The Federal government spent about $800 million in FY2011 on direct anti-malaria work, plus additional indirect funding through global funds it supports. (See\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41644.pdf\">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41644.pdf</a>\n ) Perhaps the money would be better spent donating to a Political Action Committee or a lobbying group dedicated to preserving and increasing this funding?\n<br>\n<br>\nLastly, many people believe that their money is better spent helping people in their own community. Again, this is a question of moral framework.\u00a0 Not everyone is going to have the same values for analyzing what is \"effective\".\u00a0 By telling them that they should use your criteria, rather than their own, you are encouraging this sort of response: \n<a href=\"http://xkcd.com/871/\">http://xkcd.com/871/</a>\n Allowing someone to personalize their giving to what they find most meaningful will encourage people to donate more generously.</p>", 1362006453], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1362007541237", "<p>I'm pretty sure that how many of your children/siblings/friends/etc die an early death of malaria will have a much bigger effect on having a fulfilling life than lacking music education.</p>", 1362007541], ["Marcus", "https://plus.google.com/115811589251174483775", "gp-1362007757076", "<p>I'm not.
