Although there are charities working on the problem of climate change, everyone I know in the field basically agrees that without significant government action leading to market incentives, there can be no real progress there (and that's also not that unpredictable a risk compared to, say, death-by-nanobots).  Even for the more speculative ones you mention, I have a hard time imagining a situation in which a charity would be more equipped than a government to deal with an asteroid strike.</p>", 1318035684], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1318036542855", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113667834513475506190\">Ariel</a>\n I'm approaching this from the perspective of \"how can I maximize the good I do\".  I don't have an inherent objection to working in a field as opposed to giving money to support work in it, but as someone with a relatively high earnings capacity, I think I do better with the latter.  As for why charities, they wouldn't necessarily have to do direct action.  Perhaps I would give money to support research, evaluation, education, or advocacy.</p>", 1318036542], ["Ariel", "https://plus.google.com/113667834513475506190", "gp-1318037518742", "<p>The reason I found it curious is because a number of these issues are connected to relatively high-earning fields (upper 5/lower 6 figures), so I don't think they're mutually exclusive.\n<br>\n<br>\nAdvocacy I definitely buy.

There are some people who believe that there's a significant dancer that a general AI may be invented by people who have not given thought to what they call the \"friendlyness\" problem.  This research paper describes some of the issues: \n<a href=\"http://singinst.org/upload/artificial-intelligence-risk.pdf\">http://singinst.org/upload/artificial-intelligence-risk.pdf</a>\n  Where education could come in is, if you think this is the right approach, teaching the people who might be in a position to invent an AI that this is something they should at least be aware of.

Anyway, I think that gets back to your previous note about how you evaluate the effectiveness of such a charity, how one defines \"good work\" in that case, etc.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe education suggestion is very strange to me for some reason.  First of all, I don't think it's obvious to state that if we invented AI and were replaced by it, that it would be on balance a bad outcome (by whatever metric except perhaps maximizing the number of humans alive).  More generally, although I do think that every researcher has a responsibility to consider all the possible effects of the implementation of his/her work, I also think that if it came down to a choice to not pursue groundbreaking scientific knowledge in order to avoid an uncertain bad outcome, most scientists would choose to pursue the research just due to the self-selection process.  Perhaps more importantly, even if many scientists would choose to heed the risks, it only takes one to actually go there.  But of course this has been a big debate about all scientific research for a long time.  Also, again, I'm not sure how you could evaluate effectiveness there.  \n<br>\n<br>\nFrom what I've turned up, the vast majority of charity-based research funding is for disease research (unsurprisingly).  However, of all the possible catastrophes you mentioned, I feel that people who research infectious diseases and epidemics are perhaps most aware of the catastrophic possibilities.</p>", 1318042317]]
