I've started using variables more explicitly instead of pronouns (\nx\n) for the third person, and I find it integrates well into speech, but that may be mostly because I do a lot of math and physics in my every day life. \nx\n is useful, succinct, and fairly easy to understand, and I'm gonna be pushing for \nx\n's  adoption over all other third person pronouns eventually[^necessity].\n<br>\n<br>\n[^actors]: Either people-who-act or just actors in the grammatical sense.\n<br>\n<br>\n[^necessity]: The use of a variable instead of a \"regular\" pronoun clearly isn't required here, but it's funny.</p>", 1477489994]]
