As people start to earn more, they also tend to have more responsibilities, like tending to the basic needs of children, managing parents in failing health, dealing with their own increasing medical expenses as they get older, and worrying about retirement.  An individual's personal budget will need to change as their life changes.  However, the size of their budget will probably need to increase at a slower rate than their income.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are other lots of other variants than a simple percentage: give a minimum of 10% [base charity percentage]; once the personal budget reaches $40,000 [base budget], give 50% [additional charity percentage] of (income - $40,000).
