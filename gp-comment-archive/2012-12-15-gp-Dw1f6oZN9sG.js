After all, how do you know where to focus your efforts, if you don't know what is working and what is not?\n<br>\n<br>\nAre you asking newcomers where they heard of you? If not, that's an old and simple trick you could use. As newcomers come in the door, ask them where they heard of you. Add tick marks to one of 5-6 categories you have set up as they tell you.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnother trick is to give out discounts, or even free passes, via your advertising networks. Have the pass include some sort of clue as to which kind of ad it came from.\n<br>\n<br>\nFinally, note that in advertising, it's not so simple as an ad working or not. Ads can also raise awareness, which is very valuable to you, but is harder to measure.</p>", 1355620099], ["John", "https://plus.google.com/100633726263571579985", "gp-1355673535506", "<p>In addition to \n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111102660583646544610\">Lex</a>\n's thoughts it is also interesting though more \u00a0difficult to try to find out from your frequent dancers how they decide to come or not: \u00a0schedule conflicts, band/caller, notices, other friends, etc. I think a large portion of a dance goers are \"regulars\" and knowing what causes them to not come could be valuable. Also attempting to get feedback from newcomers before they leave to see what they thought. As someone once pointed out if you get 10 new people at each dance and one of them becomes a regular at twice a month that would be 24 regulars in a year.\u00a0</p>", 1355673535], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1355684644403", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100633726263571579985\">John</a>\n\u00a0\"10 new people at each dance and one of them becomes a regular at twice a month that would be 24 regulars in a year.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nRight, though there's attrition too.</p>", 1355684644]]
