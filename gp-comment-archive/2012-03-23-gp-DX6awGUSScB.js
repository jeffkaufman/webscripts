All so you can respect someone's right to ride barefoot?  I don't blame T employees for a second...\n<br>\n<br>\nLastly...say you DO happen to befall an unfortunate exposure or accident while riding the T (the risk isn't zero, and don't say it is) and land yourself in the hospital with a nasty bill over your head because your open wound was infected or contaminated by \"some means under the MBTA's responsibility.\"  10 years clean or not, you expect me to believe you wouldn't go after them?\n<br>\n<br>\nI don't disagree with the premise that you should be able to do what you want when there aren't rules governing it.
