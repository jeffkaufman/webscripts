Many religious people have a form of religion that says very little about what your personal beliefs must be and interacts only a little with science.  I'm not convinced that that's a bad thing.  I'm not even convinced that highly religious people who feel a direct connection to god and have many things that they do or do not do for religious reasons are worse off for their beliefs.</p>", 1311715543], ["Danner", "https://plus.google.com/114987071963782993407", "gp-1311722993256", "<p>So I apologize, \"We don't do this with other beliefs\" - I don't hold such a strong an opinion of god/no god to call it a belief. its just an idea that I have an opinion on. This goes with my overall philosophy, Which is to have a very low set of beliefs. my view of beliefs is that they are something that you would kill or die for, and it is my opinion that people shouldn't have too many things to kill or die for. granted, my few beliefs form a very wide foundation, but it is only made up of a few stones.\n<br>\n<br>\nsecond point: i'm fine with whatever you do on your own time to make you happy. ritual away to your hearts content. just don't force me to do the same. most importantly, recognize that you do something because of a personally held belief, and that it might not carry over to everyone else.  --what I am worried about here is the religious grounds for persecution of many individuals. \n<br>\n<br>\nI think while I lump religious persecution together, I might as well open it up to all people. There are many things that people do to make themselves happy, socially and otherwise, and i'm not convinced thats a bad thing. There are other people that affect the lives of others in a negative manner, unjustifiably, and I think that should stop. the religious part is just an excuse that people hide behind to justify their actions, and i don't think that religion can ever hold that excuse. \"God said to do it\" is wrong, every time.</p>", 1311722993], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1311723271556", "<p>I think I'm more willing to use the word belief than you are.
