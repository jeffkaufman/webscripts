[["Peter", "https://plus.google.com/103618186481362054522", "gp-1337785800779", "<p>At a dance with live music, there's another big consideration. Pianos are loud enough that they don't need amplification in a small hall, even for dancing. Therefore, in a larger hall, a sizable area near the piano doesn't really need it to be amplified, while the rest of the hall does and therefore the balance is really different throughout the hall. I find this issue particularly troublesome in C# at Pinewoods. Not having this problem, using an electronic keyboard may make the overall sound better for more of the dancers.</p>", 1337785800]]
