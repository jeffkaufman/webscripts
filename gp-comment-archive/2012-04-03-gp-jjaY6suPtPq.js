Though even if we assume that the 30ish children in rural South Dakota that your friend taught for two (?)  years would otherwise had a much less competent teacher or many more classmates, it's extremely difficult to evaluate the benefit.  I believe there's some evidence linking smaller classrooms to higher test scores, and people have all sorts of good things to say about having great teachers, but how much does it improve the lives of these students?  Do they end up happier for life?  (By much?) Do some of them get much better jobs?  What happens to them?</p>", 1333466108], ["Allison", "https://plus.google.com/109502185221418876252", "gp-1333473850134", "<p>Of course, it is difficult to evaluate!
