It could be a $100 donation plus the amount of cash the lender would save on her taxes by making a $100 donation. Or all donation, but even slightly larger than that due to the taxes saved from the extra donation (and so on).\n<br>\n<br>\nThe opportunity arises when the repayer has a higher marginal tax rate than the lender. Then you can figure out the right donation amount based on each of their taxes, and split the difference or something. \n<br>\n<br>\nI'm assuming the repayment isn't counted as income, which seems right. \n<br>\n<br>\nAfter typing all that, a problem occurs to me: If the borrower \"repays\" as a donation, then for tax purposes they probably aren't repaying at all and have tax liabilities for the gift, so the benefit above washes out or worse. </p>", 1359091719], ["David&nbsp;German", "https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481", "gp-1359121567140", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475\">David&nbsp;Chudzicki</a>\n\u00a0Gift tax is paid by the giver, and there is an exclusion of $13,000 per recipient per year.
