But it also got me thinking from a data analytic point of view - is income (even adjusted somehow for purchasing power, which also seems like a tricky problem) the best way of measuring prosperity?  What about cultural norms on possessions, differing definitions and stigmatizations of poverty, necessity for money in general (availability of social services and education for free), etc?  Does having equal purchasing power really equate to equal prosperity?  Obviously having sufficient money for necessities is important to prosperity (defined as... happiness? something else?), but that's not what the graph gets at.  Though I don't dispute there is a problem with international inequality, I think this is too one-dimensional a way of looking at it.  Not that I have much in the way of better ideas.</p>", 1318517569], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1318525717753", "<p>\"we are the (global) 1%\"?\n<br>\n<br>\nMore seriously, I remember something (I think from Paul Krugman at an LSE lecture) on the idea that increasing trade between two countries can simultaneously decrease inequality between the countries (and overall) while \nincreasing\n inequality within \nboth\n countries.</p>", 1318525717], ["Jim", "https://plus.google.com/112932743371759723915", "gp-1318534724430", "<p>Thanks for the meme!
