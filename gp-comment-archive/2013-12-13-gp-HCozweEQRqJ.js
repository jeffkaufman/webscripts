Last year when I upgraded my camera I did some research to find organizations that take old digital cameras and donate them to university research projects, mainly in developing countries. I ended up donating it to the environmental studies department at my local university, where it's being used by students in field research projects in South America. For laptops, I found a nonprofit in my city that accepts used laptops, reconditions them, and sends them to partner organizations in developing countries. I've donated most of my old computer equipment to them.\u00a0</p>", 1387114021]]
