The more surviving offspring you leave behind, the more pervasive your genes (and the traits produced by those genes, including behaviors) become in the population. It's was a big puzzle to figure out how altruism could have evolved, until the concept of kin selection came along: related individuals share many of their genes, so a behavior can be perpetuated if an altruistic individual helps a related individual. The altruist's reproductive fitness is reduced at the expense of the individual she or he helped, but the trait for altruism is passed on by the \"helpee.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI do think altruism in humans also implies some sacrifice, but it's a sacrifice measured in opportunity. In the case of Jeff and Julia, they are sacrificing the opportunity to live at a considerably higher standard of living than they actually do. Instead of giving away all that money, they could be buying a big house, a nice car, expensive vacations, custom-made musical instruments, or whatever. Even if they don't see foregoing these things as \"sacrifices\" because they aren't interested in living like that, it could still be viewed as a form of sacrifice because it represents opportunities foregone. It's not just a \"salary sacrifce\" but rather a sacrifice of all the other things that could have been done with the salary that was sacrificed.</p>", 1378380407], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1378403553955", "<p>Also: Besides living on less income (which may or may not be a major lifestyle change, depending on the amounts involved) isn't the only lifestyle change (or \"sacrifice\", although not never sacrifice for its own sake!) popular among \"effective altruists\".\n<br>\n<br>\nFor example (and this claim is just anecdotal but I think it's true), the rate of veganism is much higher in this group than the population at large.\u00a0</p>", 1378403553], ["Brad", "https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302", "gp-1378405449401", "<p>I wouldn't equate lifestyle changes with sacrifice though. And I think it's important to note that altruism isn't \"about\" sacrifice, it's just that it may involve sacrifice. Can you have altruism without sacrifice? Certainly. But as the scale of altruism increases, the level of sacrifice probably increases as well. Bill Gates could probably give away 80% of his wealth without feeling that he's making a sacrifice. But if he gave away 95% (which would still give him a very comfortable life), he might start feeling the pinch in terms of personal opportunity costs.\n<br>\n<br>\nSpeaking personally, I'm not attracted to things like a bigger house or a newer car so donating money instead of using it to buy those things does not feel like a sacrifice to me. But there are certainly other things I could do with the money I donate, some of which do appeal to my values or give me pleasure, or indeed would improve my own life in some tangible way. I think one could argue that I'm making a sacrifice even if I don't personally have a perception of sacrifice, because those opportunities are lost. You have to weigh those lost opportunities against the benefits you derive from donating.</p>", 1378405449], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1378405826670", "<p>Right, yeah. Altruism is about doing good. Effective altruism is about maximizing the good done (at a for a particular cost to yourself).
