Simplify this to two envelopes with $X and $2X, and the option to keep your envelope or switch to a third envelope containing $1.5X. Whatever envelope you have has some amount of money $Y in it. The other envelope has, with even odds, 1.5Y or .75Y. The expected value of switching, then, is the average of those two, or $1.125Y, minus the $Y in the envelope. So you should always switch in this case too!\n<br>\nThere's your problem: you must not be able to calculate the expected value by averaging the numbers you think you do.</p>", 1315275584], ["Eric", "https://plus.google.com/105086402673996622245", "gp-1315367357279", "<p>Jeff, I think I finally (FINALLY) see the problem with the logic in the proposed \"paradox\" viewpoint. The proper treatment of the problem is that the two envelopes are random variables, Y and Z, each with a 50% probability of containing either 2X dollars or X dollars.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, let S be the value of switching: S = Z - Y. Consider its expected value: E[S] = E[Z - Y]. In your second analysis, you stop here, and note that 50% of the time, Z - Y = X, and 50% of the time, Z - Y = -X. Thus, E[Z - Y] = 0. This is completely correct.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn the first (and traditional, I will note) analysis, you go on to subtract the expected value of Y (conditioned on Y) from the expected value of Z (conditioned on Y). But Y and Z are not independent random variables, so the result is not the expected value of their difference! I believe there are some more sophisticated arguments to try to salvage this viewpoint, but I think they all share the same flaw: subtly treating two dependent random variables as if they were independent.</p>", 1315367357]]
