When do you hit a limit where you both stop donating money and retain your kidneys, under the scenario you've outlined?\n<br>\n<br>\nPaying not to donate a kidney would be a one-shot game if you are obligated to meet a certain threshold of donation/giving/altruism per unit of time, and it doesn't matter how you do it. If the kidney is worth $400 (the correct amount isn't important for this), you can only save yourself that $400 once by donating a kidney instead. So you also only pay not to donate it once, although it's not clear to me when you do that (perhaps the payment is always considered part of your most recent donation).\n<br>\n<br>\nOf course, I'm not sure if Jeff or anyone else takes that view of obligation to donate.</p>", 1340353407], ["Alexander", "https://plus.google.com/112848664856303870204", "gp-1340485425096", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066\">Todd</a>\n\u00a0In my framework, I was starting from the assumption that the agent wasn't already maxed out on how much they were willing to sacrifice.\u00a0I didn't realize that Jeff plans to reduce his charitable donation if he donated a kidney.\n<br>\n<br>\nSo say his \"suffering limit\" is something like \"live with Julia on $22K/year \nand\n retain both of my kidneys,\" then in my framework he is already at his limit, and he doesn't donate more (money or kidneys).\n<br>\n<br>\n(This doesn't have the regress issue because he's already at the limit.)</p>", 1340485425], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1340510868134", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112848664856303870204\">Alexander</a>\n\u00a0I don't think it matters whether the agent is maxed or not. The kidney can only fill the knapsack by a certain amount. The agent is, perhaps, repeatedly weighing the trade-off between donating a kidney and the next marginal $X of donation. But that's not the same as paying increasing amounts not to donate the kidney, since if the agent did donate the kidney, they'd still donate the same amount of money, minus $X (assuming no additional alternatives for donation).\n<br>\n<br>\nThe only way you get that regression, I think, is if the agent feels obligated to leverage the altruistic value of his kidney, does not otherwise feel obligated to donate (or considers any other donation obligations as completely separate concerns), and also places value on not having the surgery. Then each time the agent donates money, it's a way of putting off having the surgery.</p>", 1340510868], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1340513797170", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066\">Todd</a>\n\u00a0My understanding of \n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112848664856303870204\">Alexander</a>\n's view here is that being people we're not really going to be filling a knapsack with charitable actions. \u00a0Instead we think about things on a case to case basis, where choosing to give now may increase our willingness to give later. \u00a0In his followup comment [1] he wrote:\n<br>\n<br>\n\"I think of moral sacrifice as something closer to a muscle: it can be used up, but it can also be worked out, flexed, strengthened.

I could be wrong about that, though.\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, growing the knapsack doesn't change the fundamental conception of or the trade-offs involved in deciding to donate a kidney. It would only be abandoning the concept entirely and treating the decision to donate a kidney as totally separate from monetary donations (which I think is how he\u00a0views it) that would do that.
