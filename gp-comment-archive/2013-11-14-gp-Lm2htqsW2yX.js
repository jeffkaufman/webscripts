Inflation also acts as a drag on the growth of long-term investments: if you're saving for retirement, you have to factor inflation into your estimates for how much is enough for you to live on if you plan to retire some day.\n<br>\n<br>\nMany people today complain about the low interest rates of savings accounts, but those rates are low in part because inflation is relatively low. I'm old enough to remember when a standard savings account paid 5% interest and a 5-year CD paid 10%, but inflation was running in the double digits back then (early 1980s). You actually come out ahead at today's savings account interest rates compared to the net return back then when savings accounts were losing considerably more than 5% per year to inflation.</p>", 1384767997]]
