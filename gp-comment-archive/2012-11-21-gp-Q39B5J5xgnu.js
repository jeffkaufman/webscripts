Taylor also makes a couple of nice baritone guitars.\n<br>\n<br>\nthere's also the Roger Tallroth tuning, which i'm now using on both 6-string and 12: adadad from the bottom up, the bottom string is the same pitch as a bass guitar, and uses the 10th string from a 10-string classical guitar set. LaBella and Savarez make cheap 10-string sets and you can buy singles from stringsbymail and other sources. believe it or not, no matter the rest of your guitar strings, this bottom A needs to be silver wound on nylon, or it will sound like crap.\n<br>\n<br>\nwarning: with anything lower than a guitar bottom string, doubling the courses leads to a lot of mud, no matter the tuning, which is one reason most of the instruments that use 2-string courses and go low tend toward octave pairs; it also becomes physically difficult to keep the strings close enough together to finger easily but prevent string excursion from causing them to buzz together. finally and most importantly, for good physical and psycho-acoustic reasons, it actually sounds Deeper to have an octave pairing.\n<br>\n<br>\nbut, echoing Chris once again: if you want to play in a style anything like the video, you already have the correct instrument. moving to deeper strings means slower response of the strings, regardless of what You do, and i'm personally doubtful you'll like the outcome.</p>", 1353604450]]
