When, much later, the researchers checked court records for the results of these cases, they found that the handsome men had received significantly lighter sentences.  In fact, attractive defendants were twice as likely to avoid jail as unattractive defendants.  In another study - this one on the damages awarded in a staged negligence trial - a defendant who was better looking than his victim was assessed an average amount of $5,623; but when the victim was the more attractive of the two, the average compensation was $10,051.  What's more, both male and female jurors exhibited the attractiveness-based favoritism (Kulka &amp; Kessler, 1978).\n<br>\n\"\"\"</p>", 1314202371], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1314202501540", "<p>Yeah, seems like that wouldn't explain it in those cases.</p>", 1314202501], ["Danner", "https://plus.google.com/114987071963782993407", "gp-1314209485917", "<p>I'm going to start blaming everything that happens to me on this factor.</p>", 1314209485], ["Ivan", "https://plus.google.com/101147004225363019038", "gp-1314217980698", "<p>in some circumstances, the halo effect might actually produce relevant judgments.  for example, suppose it causes you to hire someone into a position where one of their roles involves communicating directly with customers.  there's some likelihood that those customers will be affected by a similar halo effect.  they might therefore be more disposed toward a positive experience with products and services that are presented to them.  thus the employee's attractiveness makes him or her more slightly more suitable for the role.  it's not hard to make a similar argument for roles that are not customer-facing but involve teamwork.  typically, the impact is slight, but so is the halo effect, so it's at least worth considering as a possibly valid factor.\n<br>\n<br>\n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475\">David&nbsp;Chudzicki</a>\n i think phone calls would be a poor control.  to me, the sound of a person's voice and their manner of speech are not insignificant in my judgment of their attractiveness.  on top of that, it's at least plausible that visual and vocal attractiveness are correlated.  real-time text communication might be a better method for a control group.</p>", 1314217980], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1314219243629", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/101147004225363019038\">Ivan</a>\n that makes sense.  But you don't want to take it too far.  If you're hiring someone you think is going to be a whiz at algorithms you don't want to be overestimating their skills based on their looks/voice/manner of speech.  For a sales person, though, any overestimation you make is likely to be similar to what customers would make and is not a problem.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou also lose this if your attractions differ greatly from consensus.  If I find asymmetrical facial structures to be highly attractive, the halo effect might lead me to hire someone who would not have that same advantage with other people.</p>", 1314219243], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1314235029536", "<p>For what it's worth, the halo effect works the other way, too.
