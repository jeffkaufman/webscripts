Take a sensor and wire it up to something that produces current; route that current into a speaker that goes beep; voila. Add a wireless network component, and now you've got all sorts of new things that can go wrong. And if it's an alarm where a minute or two of going-wrong means people die, that's problematic.</p>", 1390277068], ["Chris", "https://plus.google.com/117346402173047680184", "gp-1390332722556", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216\">Josh</a>\n\u00a0I would think that you could have this be fairly reliable by doing things like having codes that show up on the monitoring station when the signal isn't coming through (so if a plug gets pulled or the wireless is shoddy).\n<br>\n<br>\nYou could also have the opposite and have the sensor have a speaker on it and if the alarm needs to fire and it isn't getting a response from the monitoring station, then it can use the old method.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou could also only use this sort of thing for less urgent problems.</p>", 1390332722], ["S.", "https://plus.google.com/106111921562196141993", "gp-1390763869273", "<p>My only worry would be that wireless monitors would allow providers to decide whether an alarm actually means something or not without going to look at the patient first--might be good to have a mechanism to prevent that.\u00a0 Also, I think having smarter alarms that don't promote the current tuning out of all alarms situation is probably a higher priority.\u00a0 In any case, I think both are being worked on pretty actively, especially the latter.</p>", 1390763869]]
