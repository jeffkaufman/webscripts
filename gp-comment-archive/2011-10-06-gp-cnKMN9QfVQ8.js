This article (\n<a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2010/sb2010079_119155.htm\">http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2010/sb2010079_119155.htm</a>\n) gives about 1 in 35, and that's the highest estimate I've seen. That still drops the expected exit to 166,000. It's hard to say without time data, but that seems barely worth it.\n<br>\n<br>\nOf course, getting into YC or another incubator raises those odds considerably. I definitely think it's a great idea if you make it into one of those. But since they only have a 2% acceptance rate, and don't start until the summer, I hope that doesn't stop you from getting the BIDA dances rolling now.\n<br>\n<br>\nEDIT: I realize that I'm taking mostly the \"oh noes weekly BIDA dances might not happen\" angle.
