One of the main claimed advantages of uUSB over miniUSB was its improved durability over many plug-unplug cycles, and if you look closely at a uUSB male connector, it's got little springs on top that certainly have something to do with that.</p>", 1354132736], ["Alex", "https://plus.google.com/100936518160252317727", "gp-1354161796077", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/105024376133521186824\">Lucas</a>\n\u00a0exactly -- I guess I was ambiguous -- it's not that Apple has special magnets, just that they have used magnets to solve this problem. Remember that we're talking about a plug that\n<br>\n<br>\n1. is tiny and therefore can't be made with fragile parts, or parts that are small relative to the plug\n<br>\n2. has to maintain excellent contact on all pins 99.999% (or more) of the time\n<br>\n3. will be plugged and unplugged 10,000 times (design lifetime of uUSB)\n<br>\n<br>\nYou are correct that they have twice as many pins as necessary (according to wikipedia), but it has a lot of nice properties. With fewer pins, or even just an even number of them, you'd have to be much cleverer and more careful, with some autodetection protocol and failsafes built in. Swapping hot with ground by accident or putting +12V on the communications pin could be very bad news. And I'm not sure you could fit a fifth pin easily into a package as small as uUSB while satisfying the requirements above.</p>", 1354161796]]
