However, taking the Medicaid example, there are very good practical reasons not to extend that program beyond the United States. US citizens pay taxes, have paperwork/IDs that allow the federal government to keep track of them, etc. As such, we can get certain guarantees about how Medicaid will work with US citizens that we couldn't get with non-citizens (and particularly, people not living in the US).\n<br>\n<br>\nThere's no moral reason why people living in Brazil shouldn't be eligible for Medicaid in the abstract, if you think Medicaid is a good thing to have exist. But arguably there's a moral reason, and certainly there's a bureaucratic/logistical one, for them not to be eligible for the US version. No one in Brazil pays taxes toward it. We would have no framework for tracking individuals and ensuring appropriate distribution of benefits. We would have no enforcement mechanisms if we discovered malicious behavior.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you're talking about charitable giving, this may all be moot, but since you chose a government program as an example, I think it's worth pointing out that in that kind of case, there is justification for taking care of our own in the narrower sense. If and when we gain 'jurisdiction' over other places, we can broaden the scope of such programs.</p>", 1352388465], ["Allison", "https://plus.google.com/103741579182942078941", "gp-1352389103800", "<p>I agree that all people should count equally in terms of \"taking care of our own,\" but I think there is something to be said for helping people in wealthy countries like the US. \u00a0If we're able to create strong, healthy communities, there's less of a day-to-day emotional burden on individuals, freeing them to be more productive and able to help others outside of their more immediate\u00a0community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf I'm seeing homeless men and women every day, there's a nontrivial amount of emotional energy that goes into responding to that, even if I give them nothing. \u00a0There's guilt, shame, and reasoning about why my money is more effective elsewhere. \u00a0You can train yourself not to care or think about it, but that may not be the right thing to do. \u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nFurther, taking care of your own establishes strong community morals that obviously extend to aid elsewhere; by not establishing that as a community, does other aid miss out in the long run?\n<br>\n<br>\nMy questions are: at what point does the mental and emotional baggage of witnessing failing individuals and doing nothing to help actually hurt giving more broadly? \u00a0Are we training the empathy out of our children? \u00a0Out of ourselves? \u00a0With\u00a0quieter\u00a0aid like giving, are we setting a bad example for our neighbors, essentially telling them that apathy is okay? \u00a0When does not \"taking care of our own,\" start hurting more impact per dollar giving?</p>", 1352389103], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1352399895545", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066\">Todd</a>\n\u00a0You're right and I wasn't clear enough: I don't actually think worldwide medicaid would work well, at least not in a \"just expand it to everyone\" sense.\n<br>\n<br>\nI entended the medicaid example to illustrate the problems with drawing circles of \"our own\" that are too narrow. \u00a0There can also be problems with drawing them too large, but I think the problems are more practical issues of \"how do we coordinate this program over all these people all over\" than moral ones of \"who should be covered\".</p>", 1352399895], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1352400352472", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103741579182942078941\">Allison</a>\n\u00a0Another way to avoid the emotional energy that goes into \"witnessing failing individuals and doing nothing to help\" would be more gated communities or otherwise segregating people.\n<br>\n<br>\n(While I have negative reactions to that idea, I think they're basically all cached thoughts, my upbringing speaking.)\n<br>\n<br>\nIn a purely consequentialist sense, there's probably an amount of seeing poor people that maximizes the tradeoff between promoting charitable acts and draining emotional energy.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"taking care of your own establishes strong community morals that obviously extend to aid elsewhere\"\n<br>\n<br>\nDoes it, though? \u00a0It seems that you could have a system with relatively generous support for people in the community or within some political entity but little support for people outside that.
