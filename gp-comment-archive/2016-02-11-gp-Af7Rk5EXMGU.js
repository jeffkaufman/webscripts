I wish the standard library avoided writing const-unsafe (or otherwise nonconforming) code; I know it\u2019s sometimes unavoidable, but that glibc implementation is not one of those times. This is undefined behavior, which for my test program turns into a segfault when I try to actually modify the data (because it\u2019s mapped read-only).\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, in the nearly-conforming function you wrote, you declare\u00a0last_slash as a char*, but then have\u00a0path[last_slash] = '\\0' instead of *last_slash = '\\0'. I know at the end you say you haven\u2019t tried to compile these, but that still bothered me.
