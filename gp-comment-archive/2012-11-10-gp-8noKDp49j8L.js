A good situation. Suppose our mind-simulating technology improves so that we could actually simulate many many more minds. But the new minds would have to run on the same hardware, so the olds ones must be terminated to make room for the more efficiently-run minds. (assume that no one else knows or cares particularly about any of the minds that will be terminated)\n<br>\n<br>\nIs this a good thing to do?\n<br>\n<br>\nI find maximizing total utility pretty on intuitive, so I'm trying to press on it a bit, in a way that relates to this post.
