Meeting donations aren't saving, and it's an optional activity, so it's not \"necessary spending\" either.  This leaves donations and allowance.  If I'm giving money away to try to make the world a better place, my quaker meeting is not the best place to give.  Other places do much better, so my donations should go to them.  This leaves allowance, which makes sense because meeting fills a similar role in my life to other social events (contra dancing, music, eating out) that also come out of allowance.\n<br>\n<br>\nSome of this is that I'm not religious; I go to quaker meeting because I enjoy doing so, not because I think I'm religiously obligated to.</p>", 1321914693], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1321914964934", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103741579182942078941\">allison</a>\n \"what would be the maximum price that I would be willing to pay in order to attend, given my current budget?\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThis suggests that if I really enjoy doing something, and they have a box out for donations, it might make sense for me to put $30 in even if they have a sign saying the suggested donation is $5.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt's also hard to tell what the maximum price someone would pay is.

I look at a tomato's price and can say \"that's too much\" or \"that's a great deal.\"  Whether or not I'm willing to spend a set amount depends on how much I've been craving tomatoes, how much else I'm planning to buy soon, and how close I am to my budget limit for the week/month/whatever (that is, how much I've already spent).  Since discretionary spending really boils down to spending things on things to make you happy, so basing the decision on gut/emotion/impulse seems reasonable.  For the dances, you're also paying travel to see places and friends you might not otherwise, which is different than just the entrance fee.</p>", 1321920070], ["John", "https://plus.google.com/100633726263571579985", "gp-1321922441859", "<p>We judge how much we want to pay for things partly by comparison shopping. For contra dances the  regular rate is usually $8 - $10 with occasional  instances of more.  Knowing that these dances are non-profit with the revenue gong to pay for rent, musicians and callers, and miscellaneous expenses like insurance and stuff as a consumer I assume the dance has set its rate to cover  costs and build up a reserve for emergencies. My attitude therefore is I'll pay what is asked. And for dances it is a pretty good deal - dancing, good music, meeting up with friends and many congenial people for a ~3 hour stint. And you get some exercise too. Movies, bar hopping, and most other forms of entertainment are much more costly.  My RedSox ticket costs $50.</p>", 1321922441]]
