Washing isn't always possible on a long drive at night, so I keep moist towelettes in the car and when I'm getting sleepy I pull over and wipe my face with them. Maybe it's just me, but this works much better for me than coffee and keeps me alert for at least 30-45 minutes (sometimes longer), at which time I have to wash my face again. I agree that playing music, even if I'm just playing music in my own head, helps as well.</p>", 1380014826], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1380513898332", "<p>My recent experience has been somewhat similar to Brad's.
