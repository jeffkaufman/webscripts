I quit my job to be a stay at home mom when my first child was born, but I knew that I wanted to return to work in five years or so and start a new career in software. Attending a bootcamp wasn't compatible with caring for my kids, but I was afraid that I didn't have enough motivation to keep up with self-study without some form of accountability, so I've been working on my master's in computer science part-time.  Because my choice to leave the workforce was independent of my desire to switch careers, there really wasn't any opportunity cost, and the tuition at my local state school has been very reasonable.  That said, I am learning basically none of the skills I need for an entry-level job.  In four years in this program, not a single living person has ever looked at my code.  So I basically still have to do all the self-study I would have had to otherwise, on top of jumping through the hoops provided by my classes.  The only thing I think I'm getting out of the program is some reassurance that \"I'm on track\".  If I were just doing independent study I would feel more anxious that I wasn't doing enough to prepare.  I do hope that my degree will signal something positive to employers - but I've realized it is not remotely sufficient on its own.</p>", 1526483509]]
