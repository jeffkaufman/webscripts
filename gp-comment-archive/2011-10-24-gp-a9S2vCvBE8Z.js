I think climate change could reduce their total 2050 population pretty significantly -- one death now could equal ~10 (? guesstimate) fewer people in 2050, I'd imagine.

I'm dubious it'll occur in any significant way by 2050 ... at least not be humans.

Space fuel is expensive, and even if it gets cheap you need a phenomenal amount of it to carry a person and her myriad support systems to, say, Mars. It would be a whole lot cheaper to just give everyone condoms. Besides, colonization would probably look something like this: ark flies off to distant planet with a handful of people, those people reproduce on new planet, everyone at home is still toast.
