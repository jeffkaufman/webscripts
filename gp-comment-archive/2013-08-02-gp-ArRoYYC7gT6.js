Most recently, I had a torn meniscus in my left knee that made it very painful to walk (though bicycling was no problem). The doctor I saw recommended living with the pain for a few years to see if it would heal itself, and it did. Surgery was an option but he said that the surgery sometimes makes things worse so it was worth seeing if the problem would go away on its own. I was grateful for that advice, although \"living with the pain\" was difficult; it felt like someone was putting a knife into my knee and twisting it with every step.\n<br>\n<br>\nAbout 15 years ago I developed a severe case of thoracic outlet syndrome, a repetitive strain injury that's actually much more common than carpal tunnel syndrome, from using the mouse on my computer. I couldn't use the computer for more than 5 minutes without my right hand going numb and turning white. I did so many things, it's impossible to know which one (or which combination of things) eased my symptoms: I switched to voice-recognition software for my work, I had five years of weekly Alexander Technique lessons, four years of weekly massage therapy sessions, a bunch of stretching and strengthening exercises from a physical therapist, and I had a lift installed in my left shoe after one of my physical therapists observed that my left leg was half and inch shorter than my right (which was verified by x-ray). \u00a0After five years of all this I was able to use my right hand normally again, although even now I can only use my mouse left-handed; if I use it with my right hand my symptoms start coming back after a few days. Sometimes I wonder if this is just something that needed five years to heal, and all my interventions had no actual effect.\n<br>\n<br>\nI think the body in general has a powerful ability to heal itself, and I've had a number of problems come and go over the years with no treatment and no change in my behavior. Sometimes it seems that patience may be the most effective medicine.</p>", 1376328862], ["Alpa", "https://plus.google.com/104723814840831607662", "gp-1395855505811", "<p>What is toe-strike?</p>", 1395855505], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1395932953629", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104723814840831607662\">Alpa</a>\n\u00a0When you're walking you can either put your toe or your heel down first.
