A friend has one in his.  Part of what you need to decide is what your minimal power needs will be in case of an extended blackout.  I'm guessing we could run the stuff we cared about on an SPS, since it's pretty much the fridge.  Heat is definitely a worry \u2013 I don't know of a heating system that operates without electricity, and I don't think you can just plug them in.  Our system just needs it to operate the ignition &amp; burner control, though, one of the rare advantages of steam.</p>", 1532125700], ["Brian", "https://plus.google.com/114156500057804356924", "gp-1532151381554", "<p>Operates without electricity: a wood-burning stove.</p>", 1532151381], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1532293944251", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114156500057804356924\">Brian</a>\n yes, though only gets us heat.
