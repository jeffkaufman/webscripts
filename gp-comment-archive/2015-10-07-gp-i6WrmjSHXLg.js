If you're just writing off the cost, that's your call.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you're looking for other options, a line to pursue might be the inspection. If you had the house inspected before purchase and the inspector missed that; they might have insurance to cover something like that. I'd say outside chance, but am totally outside my knowledge base on this one.\n<br>\n<br>\nEither way, as much as $50K in unexpected expenses sucks; I'm really glad you found it and got it cleaned up rather than living with it seeping into things.</p>", 1444495593]]
