Half of ad clickers will see the video, half will see something else (unrelated?), and the allocation will be made as randomly as possible. Thanks to cookies, we can later target all clickers with ads for the follow-up survey, and we will know who were in the intervention and who were in the control group. Correct?\n<br>\n<br>\nBelow are some thoughts, nothing new to you probably, but just to cover some aspects.\n<br>\n<br>\n1.\tIf there are one thousand clicks on survey ads, do we have a sense of what % will complete the survey?\n<br>\n<br>\n2.\tWhen to do follow-ups: Ideally, we would make several spread out in time over several years. Say 1 month, 1 year, 3 years. Does that work technically? E.g., how long do the cookies last, will too many participants get new computers so we lose track of them?\n<br>\n<br>\n3.\tSurvey questions: Since the survey won\u2019t be connected to the video, can\u2019t it be a diet survey without posing leading questions? E.g. asking (illustration suggestion): do you eat a) potato, b) rice, c) chicken, d) egg, e) fish? When deciding what animal foods to ask about, it makes sense to focus on those with most impact on suffering, so afaik that means chicken, egg, and fish. If I could only ask about one, I\u2019d probably ask about \u2018chicken\u2019 rather than \u2018meat\u2019.\n<br>\n<br>\n4.\tSpeculating: It would be great to get data on what people choose to consume rather than what they say they consume. Say instead of asking them \u201cdo you eat,\u201d we offer \u201cchicken\u201d vs \u201cveggie burger\u201d (oversimplified example) and record the choice. I don\u2019t have any good ideas for how to do that but if anyone else does, please let us know.\n<br>\n<br>\n5.\tThe cookie will be tied to the computer, right? So someone might use the computer to watch the video and someone else to answer the survey. Maybe this is not a substantial problem since most in the target group use their own computers, but it needs to be considered. E.g. can one see whether a public computer was used to view the video and filter those replies out?\n<br>\n<br>\n6.\tIf people need to allow/enable the cookies, it should lead to another step of participant loss, and we would need to account for that in the choice of number of initial ad clicks we need.\n<br>\n<br>\n7.\tIs it considered ethical to do this kind of research? I mean targeting and surveying people without them ever knowing what it\u2019s about. Doesn\u2019t seem like a problem to me but something to consider.\n<br>\n<br>\n8.\tFyi, I\u2019m also interested in funding and possibly raising funds among friends for this kind of research.

There should be people for which this is the first exposure to animal suffering info , and it might spark something but they may not go veg for years. On the other hand, you have people for which the video is the tipping point. Then we have all the cases in-between these extremes. In my limited experience, going veg often takes a good while (one or a couple of years?) even after watching a video about factory farming, and in that perspective the 30-day period is a fairly narrow window to measure people becoming vegetarians.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"But it also overcounts people who ate little and now eat none.\" Yea, I agree. Having data on degrees of changed consumption would give a better \u00a0picture of the impact though. But there are pros and cons to trying to measure the degree (cons like maybe posing leading questions.)\n<br>\n<br>\nRe the need for baseline data, my impression is that it's considered good practice in RCTs to collect it and verify that the intervention and control groups are similar enough (could be different by chance or failed randomization). It also makes sense that the effect size estimate should be more precise with baseline data as long as the intervention and control groups are at least a little different due to chance. I could be wrong though and I don't know in which situations it's redundant. \u00a0I just base my impression on reading things like the quotes below and if I ran the study, I'd need to dig into it more. \u00a0\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nLecture notes on RCTs:\n<br>\n\"An overview of the RCT design....\n<br>\nThe amount of baseline data that needs to be collected does not have to be excessive, because the randomization process should result in identical groups.
