This in turn might make the meat-loving populace much less hostile to the establishment of social structures (in the form of either social stigma or government regulation) against the use of real meat.\n<br>\n<br>\nReal humans don't support or object to things in a vacuum. They are more likely to decide they really care about things that are easy for them to care about without harm to their established way of life.

The big debate in the US now about labeling GMO food offers an example of how this may play out: if GMO labeling becomes a requirement, most food products sold in supermarkets will be labeled as containing GMOs. This could either drive lots of consumers away from conventional foods or else \"normalize\" GMOs and cause consumers to say, \"hey, I've been eating GMOs all along and I'm fine, maybe it's nothing to worry about.\" The GMO lobby is aware of this but isn't keen to perform the experiment in case it doesn't work out in their favour, which is why they oppose labelling.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere will always be some people who prefer \"real\" meat due to traditionalist tendencies, mistrust of lab meat, or actual differences in flavour and texture (e.g., some people avoid farmed salmon for taste reasons, not just because fish-farming causes environmental damage, involves the use of antibiotics, and is less sustainable than eating wild-caught Pacific salmon). But most consumers don't care and just buy based on price and perception. Labeling plays a big role in perception. Farmed salmon is the default in most supermarkets and I'd be surprised if more than 10% of consumers even know there is an alternative, because it's not labeled \"farmed.\" Same goes for shrimp. I'm sure there will be a requirement to label lab-grown meat as such, and getting over the stigmas associated with that perception could take time. It'll be interesting to see how perceptions evolve if GMO labeling ends up being required in the United States.</p>", 1382012992], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1382019076292", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302\">Brad</a>\n\u00a0\"actual differences in flavour and texture\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI suspect the flavor and texture differences will be much larger than farmed vs wild-caught salmon.</p>", 1382019076], ["Brad", "https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302", "gp-1382019526953", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008\">Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman</a>\n\u00a0Yes -- although probably not really noticeable in ground meat.</p>", 1382019526]]
