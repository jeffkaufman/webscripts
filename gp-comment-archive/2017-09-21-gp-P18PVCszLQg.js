This would be the equivalent to saying that we can measure the value of a human life by looking at the cheapest option available to save lives. So since Givewell estimates that the cost per life saved for Deworm the World is $900, this reasoning would lead us to find a value of a human life of only $900. \n<br>\n3) If we really want to determine the \"exernality\" impact of having a kid, it would be a complicated analysis involving all sorts of impacts. I would imagine that in a hypothetical labor poor, resource rich world, having an average kid would have positive externalities. In a labor rich, resource poor world, having an average kid would have negative externalities. My instinct is that we are a little closer to the latter than the former (where \"resources\" includes clean air, biodiversity, access to open spaces, and so forth, in addition to more traditional kinds of capital and mineral resources), but I acknowledge having not thought this through thoroughly. And of course, any specific child-having decision is a very personal decision for a given family, and shouldn't just be driven by externalities calculations. \n<br></p>", 1505999434], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1506006427857", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111675838261170541573\">Marcus</a>\n I'm not trying to answer this question, which would be an enormous amount of work (hence my \"whether it would be better for people to have more children or fewer children in general is not at all a settled question\") but instead argue that their conclusion doesn't follow even within their incredibly limited framework.</p>", 1506006427], ["Marcus", "https://plus.google.com/111675838261170541573", "gp-1506022811366", "<p>I also retract 2a, because on re-reading, I realize you were using the 95% bound of the SCC, which is a decent high example.

If you are trying to estimate how much damage you are causing, then the marginal cost of abatement gives you zero information. Let me try another example:\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm trying to decide whether to burn some coal in my stove. I know that burning that coal will create 1 ton of particulate matter. I also know that I could install a scrubber on my neighbor's smokestack for $10 that would eliminate 1 ton of particulate matter.
