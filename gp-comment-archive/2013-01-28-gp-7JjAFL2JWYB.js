I recall reading about one attempt by MtGox to track stolen coins and freeze them when they entered the exchange, but it failed as the coins were found to have circulated and the depositor not involved\n<br>\n\u00a0- When the default Bitcoin client sends coins using an address that has more coins than needed, the extra coins go to a newly-created \"change\" address. This tends to raise the upper bound on how many hands coins have passed through between any two known parties\n<br>\n<br>\n(Also, I should point out the contraband is probably not the primary use of Bitcoin; speculative investment is.)</p>", 1359414644], ["Bryce", "https://plus.google.com/110073329443149494347", "gp-1359426054576", "<p>I saw a talk by Joan Feigenbaum a couple weeks ago that seems relevant.
