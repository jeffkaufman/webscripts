This does give me the feeling that men are there for something other than dancing, but I think it is just as likely to be simply a reflection of the different ways homophobia acts on men and women.</p>", 1343141288], ["Allison", "https://plus.google.com/103741579182942078941", "gp-1343141516393", "<p>I think that Mary's explanation for why folks \nstart\n dancing is more or less consistant with my experience (swing, contra, salsa). \u00a0And given that contra is beginner-friendly, a good proportion of dancers at any given dance will be new enough to still have those motivations. \u00a0For more experienced dancers, I feel like most of them are there to dance and/or see friends, and I've seen next to no difference between genders in terms of motivation.</p>", 1343141516]]
