From what I understand however, it has little to do with hardware limitations, and all to do with google's desire to encapsulate audio system for java developers. The current system mixes sound from all sources and maintains system control of audio (as opposed to letting a device access the audio hard buffers directly, thereby monopolizing sound), but means that you can't do much but the simplest stuff well.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt's piss poor state of affairs, that is hampering every industry from game development to medical equipment:I recently read comment from a developer who was attempting to develop monitoring equipment that had hoped to use the audio I/O for processing non-audio signals. And, of course, it means no audio apps.</p>", 1327711188]]
