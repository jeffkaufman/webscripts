I have found Peapod to be sharply higher than in-store Stop &amp; Shop prices... not just a small premium (milk gallons are $3.79/gal on Peapod vs $1.99 to $2.59 at in-store Stop &amp; Shop; store brand deli meat is typically a $1/lb premium on Peapod); plus bonus gas point deals that Stop &amp; Shop runs are only good in-store which can cause a huge effective price disparity as I book gas point savings as a reduction in my grocery bill, unless you have no use for them. Granted, I have found no price differences in catering and some sale items which sometimes can make Peapod more favorable than in-store S&amp;S especially when a promotion code plus bank cash back is applied (bank offers 10% cashback up to $10 typically on Peapod).</p>", 1516675785], ["Michael", "https://plus.google.com/106863921004414314627", "gp-1516676481564", "<p>And I recently considered trying Shaw's instacart delivery which is heavily marketed... compared three products I usually buy and all were higher on delivery by 30-70%.</p>", 1516676481], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1516684017901", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106863921004414314627\">Michael</a>\n The reason I'm comparing with Peapod is that Peapod is the cheapest delivery service around here.
