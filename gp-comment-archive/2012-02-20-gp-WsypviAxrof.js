The silk and paper ones are generally better-looking and (I think) require more skill to make; I imagine they require hand assembly and probably hand painting.  When I saw the glass flowers exhibit (last time I was up, actually), they far exceeded the standard silk and paper ones (the darkish rooms might have helped, though).  I spend probably too much time looking at tiny details on things, especially vegetation, and the glass flowers are on par with modern high-end silk flowers, at least in terms of looks.  (Silk flowers can also feel real.)</p>", 1329831966]]
