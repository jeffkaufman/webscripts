As soon as you have possession, snap it to the QB (probably in the shotgun) and have him run back to his own end zone and kneel down. Bam, safety.\n<br>\n<br>\nThen you have to free kick the ball to the other team, which is where the problem comes in. I'm not sure it's even legal to onside kick in this scenario. If you can, then it just becomes a game of who recovers more onside kicks. If not (as I suspect), then you just trade safeties over and over.\n<br>\n<br>\nThough the other thing in football is that penalties can make this really goofy. If you're on defense and you know someone is trying to do this, you just commit dead ball fouls (e.g. neutral zone infraction/unabated to the QB) over and over, driving the offense closer and closer to your own goal line. No time elapses on the game clock when this happens, so the game never actually goes anywhere.\n<br>\n<br>\nEDIT: You did mention \"intentional forfeitures and fouls\", but I think that's too vague. Consider basketball, where intentional fouls are already part of the game. They are in the NFL, too, though it's a bit less clear because the goal isn't necessary to get called for a penalty, but to commit one figuring that even getting caught is preferable to the alternative of not committing it.
