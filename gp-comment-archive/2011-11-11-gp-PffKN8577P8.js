I take the bus to school and that nearly always works fine, but I can't take the bus from where I do my classroom observations to downtown, where I pick up the bus to school.  My observations are about 5 miles away, and it takes about 25 minutes to bike.  If the bus were on time, I'd have to leave at about the same time to catch it, but in practice, the bus is often late and so I'd have to leave half an hour earlier in order to not miss the bus to school.
