In fact, it accounts for most of the evil of the past century. \u00a0Once you disregard human dignity, particularly the worth of each individual person, it's easy to kill millions in an ideological crusade for a glorious future.\n<br>\n<br>\nSimilarly, harming a single individual, say through incarceration, can be justified as necessary to protect the community from their ill doings. \u00a0But when you increase the scale of such reasoning the consequences are often quite dire. \u00a0War, genocide and discrimination of kinds, come from applying the notion of acceptable harm without regard to scale.\n<br>\n<br>\nUltimately I feel it's hubris to think we can correctly estimate the consequences of our actions and quite dangerous to be certain that we are right in wronging others. \u00a0If the harm from inaction is immediate and obvious, there can be compulsion to intervene in some cases, but generally this should be done with great forbearance. We cannot \"look into the seeds of time and say which grain will grow and which will not\", but can merely hope to do \"the right as God gives us to see the right\". \u00a0Therefore the compulsion to avoid wrongdoing, even in the services of a greater cause, is strong.</p>", 1360894366], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1360895620160", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115811589251174483775\">Marcus</a>\n\u00a0\"Rationally looking at potential courses of action and choosing the one the seems most likely to cause the greatest good for the greatest number of people is an excellent way to cause great injustices.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nIf trying to make the world better makes it worse then you're going about it very wrong.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"Once you disregard human dignity, particularly the worth of each individual person, it's easy to kill millions in an ideological crusade for a glorious future.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nHuh? \u00a0How do you get that from \"choose actions that will make people better off in aggregate\"? \u00a0Killing one person is very bad; killing a million is about a million times worse, which makes it extremely horrible. \u00a0What would make you think that would be the best way to make people better off?\n<br>\n<br>\n\"I feel it's hubris to think we can correctly estimate the consequences of our actions and quite dangerous to be certain that we are right in wronging others.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nAgreed. \u00a0Predicting the consequences of actions is extremely difficult. \u00a0But this doesn't mean we should make no actions, it means we should be careful to learn as much as we can and take the best actions.</p>", 1360895620], ["Marcus", "https://plus.google.com/115811589251174483775", "gp-1360895884823", "<p>Yes, but you need some basis for thinking that the death of one person is bad.

I feel that even people who cause more harm than good to their community or to the world have inherent rights that cannot be completely abrogated.
