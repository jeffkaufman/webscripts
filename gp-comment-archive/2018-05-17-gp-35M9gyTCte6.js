We absolutely don't want our kid's pictures on Facebook, open to effectively everyone who is our friend, or maybe even friend-of-a-friend. That way, the people who are interested in the photos can get notified when new ones are added, without either Facebook getting a hold of the photos, or sharing them with people who couldn't care less.</p>", 1526655215]]
