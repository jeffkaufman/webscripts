Let's say you're much stronger than me, so in our jobs as porters you are twice as efficient as I am.  We're both getting lots of exercise, so the strength difference comes almost entirely from how lucky we were in the genes lottery.  My naive conception of fairness would say that we should earn a similar amount, or if you should earn more it shouldn't be nearly twice as much.  Whereas if we were both salesmen, and you were bringing in twice the sales I was, it feels far less intuitively clear to me that it would be unfair for you to be paid twice as much: perhaps if I spent some time reading up on how to be a better salesman, took some classes, or if I put more enthusiasm into it, I might become a better salesman and so match your sales.  But perhaps even that is not reasonable: maybe you are a better salesman because of how you were raised, and because of your greater intelligence, verbal ability, and conscientiousness which all appear to have strong genetic components.  Is your greater success then really due to greater efforts on your part and deserving of greater reward?\n<br>\n<br>\nTo me, the problem with \"from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs\" is not that it is unfair, but that it doesn't turn out to work well.</p>", 1319674742], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1319675366729", "<p>I don't know if it's adding much to say this when I already covered it in a sense, but I think that demonstrates that fairness is not the right metric.
