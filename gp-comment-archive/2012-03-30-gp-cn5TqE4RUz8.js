The invariant among brass instruments is that the note called 'C' in the instrument's key is its fundamental frequency with no valves depressed. On trumpet, this is 'Bb2'; on horn, it's 'F1'.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis causes a couple of additional awkwardnesses with horn: first is that most players use a double horn, where the thumb valve toggles between an 'F' horn and a 'Bb' horn (fundamental = 'Bb1'). Most horn players are taught to think in 'F' and just memorize 4-valve fingerings including the occasional use of the thumb valve. Jeff's last post leads me to believe that this is not the way he would learn the horn. The second problem is that in lots of old music, the horn part is written in the key of the piece, with the assumption that the horn player will use a crook to put his instrument into that key. Modern hornists play such pieces on a double horn and must engage in mental gymnastics to transpose them into 'F'.</p>", 1333138612], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1333139644081", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110073329443149494347\">Bryce</a>\n I think I would treat this like pennywhistle: learn the fingerings of the instrument I first approached, and then get in the habit of transposing by a fifth in my head when necessary.  This is made much easier by not working with written music.\n<br>\n<br>\n(Most people learning whistle first learn 'D'.  This lets them play in D, G, Em, Bm, Amix, Dmix.  If they're going to play a different whistle, perhaps C or E, they're doing this because they want to play in a key that whistle is better suited for.  Which means that playing a differently keyed whistle is usually as simple as picking it up and identifying the appropriate start note for the tune.)\n<br>\n<br>\nI would probably approach the horn by learning to play all the notes in the key of D or G.  Which might be a big pain and a bad idea.\n<br>\n<br>\nI wonder why horns are F/Bb instead of E/F or A/Bb?</p>", 1333139644], ["Bryce", "https://plus.google.com/110073329443149494347", "gp-1333140586016", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008\">Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman</a>\n Horns are F/Bb largely for historical reasons, but there are some advantages to the two 'sides' of the horn having significantly different lengths. The main reason is that the longer tube produces a richer sound in the low range, while the shorter tube is easier to play precisely (since the partials are farther apart) in the high range. The secondary reason is that it fills in the gap that results from the lowest partials being an octave apart. On trumpet it's possible to play E3 (trumpet F#, fingering 1-2-3), and Bb2 (trumpet C, fingering 0), but not any of the notes in between. Offsetting the two keys on the horn allows the Bb side to fill in the gap between B1 and F1.</p>", 1333140586], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1333141232301", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110073329443149494347\">Bryce</a>\n Your point about the low range is good, and I hadn't thought of that, but with the high range wouldn't an E/F horn allow you to use fingerings that gave you easier partials to hit?  (I'm very new at brass instruments, though, so my impression that some partials are easier than others to hit may be wrong.)</p>", 1333141232], ["Bryce", "https://plus.google.com/110073329443149494347", "gp-1333143652351", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008\">Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman</a>\n The main difficulty in playing horn (relative to other brass instruments) is that the normal range is higher in the instrument's harmonic series. This means that the partials are closer together, so lip vibration has to be more precise to ensure hitting the right one. This is related to the fact that the horn has a small mouthpiece, but a long tube; trumpet/trombone/tuba mouthpieces scale in size with the length of the instrument. For a sense of scale (don't take these numbers as gospel: I got them from the internet, but they're close):\n<br>\n<br>\napproximate mouthpiece diameter:\n<br>\ntrumpet: 16mm\n<br>\nhorn: 18mm\n<br>\ntrombone: 25mm\n<br>\ntuba: 32mm\n<br>\n<br>\napproximate instrument length:\n<br>\ntrumpet: 4.5ft\n<br>\ntrombone: 9ft\n<br>\nhorn: 12ft\n<br>\ntuba: 18ft\n<br>\n<br>\nRelative to the F horn, Bb horn is a couple feet shorter, and therefore a fourth higher, so for any given pitch, the nearest partial is farther away. Some horn players go further, using a tripple horn, where a second thumb-valve adds a 'high-F' side to the horn, where the tube is only 6 feet long. I haven't played a tripple horn for more than 5 minutes, but in high school marching band, I played melophone (6-foot tube), which feels much more like a trumpet.</p>", 1333143652], ["Mark", "https://plus.google.com/105303832002231091966", "gp-1333166003778", "<p>Trombones are typically Bb-fundamental but notated in concert pitch.
