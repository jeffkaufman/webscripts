Say I invest $100k in some stock and a year later it's (a bit optimistically) $110k.  My gain is $10k.  If I sell it and donate the proceeds, I pay tax on the $10k growth, which would be about $2.4k (20% long term capital gains + 3.8% medicare).  So the charity receives (and I deduct) $107.6k.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf instead I donate the $110k worth of stock as stock, I pay no taxes.  The charity receives (and I deduct) $110k.  The savings is $2.4k on $110k of stock, or 2.2%.  Can you do better than that by arranging things differently, maybe optimizing for volatility or something?  Because otherwise this is a lot of hassle and tax messiness when I could just donate via a 2% cash-back credit card.</p>", 1506394918], ["David&nbsp;German", "https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481", "gp-1506426798479", "<p>You forgot state taxes - 20% Fed LTCG + 3.8% Fed NIIT + 5.1% MA LTCG = 28.9%. \n<br>\n<br>\nMore importantly, if you're building a taxable stock portfolio throughout your working life anyway, you're likely to have capital gains that are more than one year old, and bigger than 10%.
