You're obviously not that selfish, and you're probably right (though it's somewhat disheartening to admit) that a given person isn't worth the resources we'd have to spend to create the possibility of bringing them back hundreds of years from now, evaluating from a non-selfish perspective.

But the cost to you of freezing your brain probably isn't very high, relative to the overall cost. A lot of the maintenance costs for keeping your brain frozen that you mentioned aren't going to be paid by you (I'm sure that cryonics companies try to price based on the long-term costs, but it's hard to see how they could avoid needing to pay for current members with future members' fees). And on a personal level, even if the odds of success are very low, there's infinitely higher expected utility in giving yourself that small chance to go on living (assuming 0 or negative utility if you're just dead). It's going to depend on how that weighs against what else you might do with the money, of course.\n<br>\n<br>\nBut my point is more that if you're NOT very selfish, there's not much of a conversation- those resources are clearly better spent on other people.

Most of the cost (~$100K) is in the freezing, especially the getting you frozen promptly, and the long term costs are ~$100/year. Which means the long term costs can be covered with investment income on ~$10K of principle.\n<br>\n<br>\nAn argument based on \"infinitely higher expected utility in giving yourself that small chance to go on living\" makes you do silly things. I tell you \"if you give me $100 I'll technobabble you to a future after you die where you'll be infinitely happy and live forever.\" No matter how little you believe me, if there's even a sliver of a chance that I'm right then you should pay up.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe're all selfish to some degree.
