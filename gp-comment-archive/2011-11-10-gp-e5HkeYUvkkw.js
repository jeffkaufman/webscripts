That when dead a person experiences neither suffering nor joy, and so is neutral.  Killing someone usually causes them a lot of pain, and generally makes other people unhappy too.  Killing that's not socially sanctioned probably causes much more harm to the greater society (in terms of increased fear, etc) than to the one killed.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf a person was leading a happy life, and would have continued to lead a happy life had they not died, their death is not neutral.\n<br>\n<br>\n(You could read me as saying a policy like \"kill all the people who are unhappy enough that they have negative total happiness\" would be a good idea.  There are so many practical issues that it's not really: how do you know they're really that unhappy?  How do you keep this from making other people (parents, children, spouses, friends) unhappy?  What if we could make people happier in the future if they were only still living?  I also don't think very many people are that unhappy.)</p>", 1321448989], ["Pablo", "https://plus.google.com/105467680319054692970", "gp-1356559739932", "<p>I think you are underestimating the percentage of people who become vegetarian out of concern for animal welfare. \u00a0See\n<br>\n<br>\n* Rozin, P., Markwith, M., &amp; Stoess, C.
