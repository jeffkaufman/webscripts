It's a scraping mashup that overlays rentals from all the major sites (craigslist, \n<a href=\"http://rent.com\">http://rent.com</a>\n, etc.) onto google maps.  It make house hunting approximately 1 million times easier.  Especially when location is important.  As a corollary, East Arlington is currently a gigantic win...easy access to the red line, easy access to the world.  The only caveat being that when the idiot gov't of Boston/MA reduces red line services because the rich folks don't wanna pay for the average folks to get to the places of work where the rich folks don't pay people enough, east arlington's bus routes are on the chopping block and they help a LOT.  And we should play board games, especially if you move to east Arlington.  :-)</p>", 1326207459], ["Alex", "https://plus.google.com/100936518160252317727", "gp-1326208860192", "<p>+1 to Padmapper.
