The result is that people with sufficient income to drive on the road trade a portion of their income for a more efficient commute. Maybe it's a wash for them, with increased efficiency offsetting the tolls)?\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nI assume the income distribution is not sufficient to make the tolls affordable for any (or many) of the people below the certain income level, else we don't improve congestion. So those people have to find alternatives using the funds distributed from the higher-income drivers. That seems pretty disruptive. In many places, there's insufficient public transit to provide an alternative, but if that's taken into account (only raising tolls where there are sufficient alternatives), then it might work. Maybe in such cases, the funds could be used to provide free or reduced rate public transit rather than direct distribution, thereby keeping the funds in the transportation sector.\n<br>\n<br>\nHere in Georgia, there has been a fair amount of trials with toll roads and toll lanes that allow for some reduced congestion without removing free options. Might be a way to phase in such a process.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, an interesting post, as always.

On one hand, it's a completely unfair system because it's basically a lottery; none of these benefits are actually available to anyone that desires them, or even a large portion thereof. And on the other hand, the benefits are a trap for both those that enjoy them and also for everyone else that lives or works in the city \u2014 the former because they lose the benefits if they move and the latter because they're both indirectly paying for some of the benefits (housing), unable to afford others (owning a car), and incapable of making significant \nimprovements\n to any of the arrangements.</p>", 1414626167]]
