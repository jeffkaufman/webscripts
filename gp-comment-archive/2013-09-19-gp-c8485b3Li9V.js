It's insane: you have to book movers at least four months in advance if you hope to snag someone before they're entirely booked, and most of the movers jack up their prices on July 1. The sidewalks are congested with cast-off furniture, and sometimes people have to wait outside with all their stuff while the current occupants move out. Traditional moving-day supper is pizza and beer, and the pizza shops do a booming business on July 1. The other thing like that up here is the \"vacances de la construction,\" in which all construction workers take their vacation during the same two-week period in late July. All construction stops and equipment sits idle on half-repaired roads; if you need any repairs or construction done during that period you're out of luck.\u00a0</p>", 1379615019]]
