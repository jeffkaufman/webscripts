Hope your child has as many wonderful memories as I have of Magoun Ave in Medford. 39 Magoun Ave actually, a hop-skip-and jump up from the Park St. Station. Used to gallop down to the station when I heard the whistle blow and the bell clang. Watched that ol' steamer pass through the station on that Medford spur and mosey on down to the square. Used to play Indian and hide in the brush along the way, and when it came back I'd hop the last car the last few yards\u00a0up to Park St. and watch the folks board for Boston.\u00a0 Loved those old trains - hopped the freights to Boston when they came through some late mornings or early\u00a0afternoons. Then walked back home from the yards in Boston. Loooong walk.\u00a0 We moved to Magoun Ave in 1939. Played in Magoun Park daily and attended the Fist Methodist Church on Otis Street regularly.Used to get my hair cut at Benny the barbers up on Washington. My dad rented the store next to Benny's - shared the same porch steps -dads used it as a work shop. In '44 or so, moved to Dudley Street.\u00a0 Hug out with Sonny Post, Don Miller, Dick Hurley, Richie Parella, and Dick Chapman. Lost track of them all, except Dick. Joined the AF, 1952 -1974, and never went back. Fond memories tho - and there are many of my family - ol' Crooker hoodlums - still in suburban areas there, but not in Medford. Enjoy your new child - and don't ever let him hop a train.... enjoyed your site on the Medford train spur and station.</p>", 1436993494]]
