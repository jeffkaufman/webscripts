Longer-term development strategies may have a shot at bigger payoffs, but how do we tell which such programs are effective and worth funding?  It's especially challenging because the charities with the most plausible-sounding development portfolios (\n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110224307807160134588\">Oxfam</a>\n, Partners in Health, etc.) are so opaque about their own metrics.</p>", 1330745791], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1330783002725", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/101147004225363019038\">Ivan</a>\n I agree with you that we should take the approach that does the most good over the long term.  The idea of a development project that successfully lifts people out of poverty so they can pay for their own mosquito nets, afford shoes to avoid parasites, and have enough of a reserve to limit the huge stress of insecurity is incredibly appealing to me.  But as \n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481\">David&nbsp;German</a>\n says, these programs are much harder to evaluate.  It's not just that they are opaque about their metrics: you basically can't tell if a strategy works without doing controlled experiments, and to evaluate whether an approach \"breaks the cycle of poverty\" you need to run experiments that last decades.  Which means that while your paragraph that continues from \"there are many ways to contribute to needy groups that will, in the long run, effectively prevent them from facing many of the problems that they would otherwise face\" makes a lot of sense to me, I don't think investing a given amount in clean water actually does better than the same amount in parasite-treatment, even when evaluated over the long term.

However, I know most donors are haphazard and will fund random interventions.  They're already diversifying plenty, so I may as well fund the one I think is best.
