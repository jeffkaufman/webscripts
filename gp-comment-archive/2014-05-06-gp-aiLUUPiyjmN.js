But what if that's not true? What if, for instance, building luxury housing in the city actually draws in people previously living elsewhere, like in outlying suburbs? In this case, there may not be any filter effect.\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nIn the second case, it seems like filtering only works when the luxury housing is a net increase. If a developer buys an old factory building and makes it into luxury lofts, this adds a certain number of units to the market. But if the developer buys existing housing and renovates it, that might not be true. In fact, if a developer buys lower-income housing and converts it into a luxury option, it is very likely it will lead to an overall reduction in housing as units are consolidated or replaced by amenities. In that situation, we have lost more housing than people can filter up into.\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nI think the former problem is one that is very difficult to control, because trying to govern who gets to rent a unit is very messy. It does seem like the second one is easier to handle, though - just require that any developments on existing residential properties do not lead to an overall reduction in the number of units, either in the same structure or through partnered construction in the same area.\u00a0</p>", 1399387715], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1399388873455", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109686970531250960199\">Hassan</a>\n\u00a0\"What if, for instance, building luxury housing in the city actually draws in people previously living elsewhere, like in outlying suburbs?
