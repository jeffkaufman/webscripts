In developing a process like this, before you started reanimating all the people that had frozen themselves in the past, you would run some detailed tests.  Something like: get a volunteer about to die, run a lot of mental tests, freeze them, reanimate them, run the tests, see what changed.</p>", 1314895793], ["Julia", "https://plus.google.com/114588710186521489410", "gp-1314968581344", "<p>Jim - Most people now don't spend their lives wondering what they would be like if they'd gotten different nutrition as children, or had slightly different genes.
