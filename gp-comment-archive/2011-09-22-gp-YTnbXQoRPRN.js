For the first, perhaps electricity gets very expensive.  For the second, poor financial management.

I don't see how it could be so high unless it bakes in an expectation that cryonics operators are cutting corners in a big way.

Big financial and Internet businesses have datacenters with next to no downtime, and a server farm is tremendously more complex and sensitive than a compressor farm.

I think the important thing is that you can actually have quite a bit of downtime without heating the bodies above a threshold.\n<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, they could be accidentally defrosting people somewhat often, but it's in their interest (both the individual employees and the company) to hide that.
