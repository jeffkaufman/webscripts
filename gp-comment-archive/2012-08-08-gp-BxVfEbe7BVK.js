That can apply to a lesser extent to things falling short of surgery as well.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are also aspects of appearance that are very difficult or impossible to change short of (or even through) surgery. Height is an example- you can wear tall shoes if you're short, though that can only do so much, and if you're tall you can't even do that much to look shorter.\n<br>\n<br>\nI also agree with someone (not sure who) who mentioned that appearance seems more tied to people's identity. Look at how people regarded the changes to Michael Jackson's appearance. It was like he was trying to be a different person. Getting better at a musical instrument (or any other trainable skill) doesn't carry that kind of implication.</p>", 1344474114], ["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1344482738171", "<p>Appearance is much more pervasive.

I imagine that most non-musicians know that too. I suppose people know that models look impossibly better than normal people, but I still think there's a sense in which people say \"that's how I should ideally look\".
