Stopping and opening the door to look and listen might be the only option there, I don't know.  All of the active crossings the MBTA interacts with that I know of have signals, plus either barriers or extremely slow moving and loud trains (grand junction near MIT)</p>", 1501081111], ["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1501082770609", "<p>Yeah, it seems like adding \"at a crossing without barriers or signals\" might be an easy change in that case.\n<br>\n<br>\n(Unless those barriers or signals routinely fail to function correctly or something, but I suspect that's not the case, or we'd have a lot more train vs vehicle collisions.
