Two thirds of the people who oppose abortion still think it should be legal in specific circumstances -- e.g. rape and incest, or medical issues (especially the life of the mother, but fetal abnormalities are also be seen as sufficient by many).

(I think some part of animal cruelty laws are there as much to improve the way humans behave as to protect the animals)\n<br>\n<br>\nI think an interesting parallel is the short story \"the ones who walk away from Omelas\" (\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas</a>\n). The hook for that story as I recall it was that, by some magic, creating a miserable life for one child could basically ensure that everything else in the city went well. Now, if this was a state of being imposed by nature (eg, some virus that made everyone healthy but made 1 in a million miserable), I'd think that it would not be a bad city to live in. But if it was a state of being that required that the city impose the misery on a specific child... well, that seems morally wrong. So the question is: would you prefer to live in Omelas or in another city where maybe more children are miserable, but you did not cause it?\n<br>\n<br>\nMaybe a more realistic example is vaccination: we choose (for the most part) as a society to inject our children with vaccines that statistically have some chance of causing side effects, in return for a statistically much larger reduction in bad health outcomes. This is considered, by most, to be a good thing. Now, let's make this unrealistic for the sake of examining morality: what if the vaccine caused 1 child death for every 10 deaths it saved? Ok, I'd still take that bargain*. But now, what if we could make a cure for diseases only by killing a specific child: would we kill one child to make a cure for 10 children? I probably wouldn't, even though the math is the same*. We make statistical tradeoffs all the time that don't scale when they become specifics (eg, the VSL for a human life is about 8 million dollars, but we would never apply that VSL to a specific individual: I can't pay the government 8 million dollars and get a license to kill one person, for example)\n<br>\n<br>\n*Interestingly, in the first case, I think there is a threshold at which I wouldn't make that tradeoff: eg, I probably wouldn't push the vaccines if they only saved 1.1 lives for every life lost.

Ok, I'd still take that bargain. But now, what if we could make a cure for diseases only by killing a specific child: would we kill one child to make a cure for 10 children? I probably wouldn't, even though the math is the same\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI think you can rephrase the second one to make it more palatable. \u00a0There are eleven children who are all going to die of a disease. \u00a0They draw lots and one of them is killed early to allow the other ten to live. \u00a0To me this sounds much better than letting all eleven die.</p>", 1360349438], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1360351766887", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100533872344198336746\">Madeleine</a>\n\u00a0\"Larger numbers include embryos lost before the woman is even aware of the pregnancy, plus some speculation, using very sensitive blood testing to detect the implantation event a week before it's detectable via urine tests.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm suspicious too, but I think for people who believe an embryo is equivalent with a child it's very important.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"You started with 'if you believe embryos count morally' (most people would agree with this statement), not 'if you think all human embryos have the same right to life as an adult human' (most would disagree with this)\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI was more explicit in my blog post; you're right that I'm not arguing with the majority view.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"10% prevention of spontaneous abortion is still a lot less than the elective abortion rate\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure what you're saying here.</p>", 1360351766], ["Mad", "https://plus.google.com/100533872344198336746", "gp-1360365948975", "<p>I'm saying what you said (\"If you could increase the chances of an embryo making it through to birth by 1% by some cheap-in-bulk means then I think that avoids more embryo deaths than successfully stopping all abortions.\") still isn't true even with your high-end miscarriage numbers and the 10%-instead-of-1% update.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrom numbers in your [2]: 10% of pregnancies end in intentional abortion, and 50% end in miscarriage.
