A few days ago I wrote a blog post entitled \"The Joys of Giving Large,\" using a certain couple in Boston named Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman and Julia Wise as an example, then talking a little about my own experiences in giving and finishing with a paragraph on effective altruism. It has attracted some attention and comments, including an expression of interest from our director of corporate giving.\u00a0</p>", 1415969762]]
