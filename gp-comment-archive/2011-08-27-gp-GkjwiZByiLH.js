Often they just don't have both hands free to properly loosen the boom, but many musicians also don't understand the concept of loosening, adjusting, then tightening, to avoid wearing down the mechanism.\n<br>\n<br>\nI agree that boom mikes are the way to go, unless the musician (preferably) has a clip-on mike for their fiddle or other instrument.</p>", 1314888441]]
