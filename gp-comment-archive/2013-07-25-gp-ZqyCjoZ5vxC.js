And even though our moral intuitions tend not to be refined enough to allow us to comfortably separate such cases from the norm, we sometimes do things like cut off life support in those cases.</p>", 1374848642], ["Alex", "https://plus.google.com/100936518160252317727", "gp-1374849551192", "<p>I roughly agree with \n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066\">Todd</a>\n\u00a0-- there is a huge distinction between current ability to empathize and the anticipated capacity to do so.
