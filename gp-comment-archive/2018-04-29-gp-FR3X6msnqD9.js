[["Mae", "https://plus.google.com/107591005438840138933", "gp-1545070532561", "<p>Hi Jeff,  I have been researching similar methods for reducing the  noise in a first floor condo I recently purchased which has a heartbreaking amount of impact noise due to a sticky situation with the new renters upstairs having large dogs, and one is an enthusiastic young dog. Though the dogs are hopefully temporary and not technically allowed there, footsteps for some people are also problematic below, and the STC rating could be much better. Do you have any idea how much that double layer of gwb with Green Glue added to the effectiveness of your assembly? Or really if the Green Glue is necessary. In my case the upstairs flooring is laminate wood, then there is a radiant heating system, then there is plywood, engineered wood joists, and currently we think a directly fixed single layer of 5/8\" gwb. I was looking at pricing ceiling demo, then adding r-19 fiberglass between joists, hanging the new ceiling from RSIC-1's and 25 guage hat channel, 2 layers of 5/8\", and a perimeter acoustic sealant.  Just wondering if you had any insight on whether or not adding green glue is necessary and if you had not added mass to the floor if you think the assembly would have suffered? Thanks so much for your time. Congrats on your successful project here, I enjoyed reading about your process.</p>", 1545070532], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1545142514769", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107591005438840138933\">Mae</a>\n I don't know much more than I wrote in the post, but what you're proposing sounds good.  I would expect putting green glue between your two layers of 5/8\" not to add too much cost or effort, and do a lot for sound, but I don't know.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt's also hard for me to tell how much benefit came from putting drywall and green glue on the underside of the subfloor.  I could see arguments for a lot (damp the noise at the source) or not that much (a ceiling that can vibrate is much better).</p>", 1545142514], ["Mae", "https://plus.google.com/107591005438840138933", "gp-1545164814614", "<p>Thanks Jeff.
