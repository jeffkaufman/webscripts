[["Marcus", "https://plus.google.com/111675838261170541573", "gp-1342651977604", "<p>\"it should be noted that the contra community is still, by default, a straight space even if it's relatively welcoming to queer folk\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI do have some queer non-contra-community acquaintances who wondered about the possibility of a proper gender-free contra because they weren't very interested in coming to a \"normal\" contra. This was an eye-opener for me, making me realize that while it is a start, being LGBT friendly and accepting same-gender dancing may not be sufficient (there is also somewhat less same-gender dancing at Glen Echo than in Boston).\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm not sure if a \"gender-free\" dance will necessarily change the culture sufficiently, though. Less gendered language (lead/follow vs. gents/ladies, for example, though even lead/follow isn't perfect) is an obvious step, but a small one - and still not necessarily easy, since it would involve getting visiting callers to change their style (my Modern Western club would sometimes need to ask visiting callers to remove sexist jokes from their repertoire, but that's easier than removing all gendered language). I know NEFFA has a successful gender-free dance during the weekend, and the JP contra manages it weekly, but will this model translate to all dance communities? Part of the success of the NEFFA dance is due to it being an outlier - as an outlier, people are more willing to dance with same sex partners, and wear armbands to help prevent confusion. I didn't go to the JP dance enough to really know how it works (does it require arm bands?). But at a hetero-dominated dance, would being \"gender-free\" just default back to the standard 98% male lead/female follower role? Also, I know that some new dancers, and some \"traditional\" dancers can find traditional gender roles a useful crutch - in Glen Echo sometimes such dancers are confused when encountering a same-gender or gender-swapped couple in the line - would 100% gender-free dancing make dancing harder for these people? I know in my Modern Western club, we used to ask dancers who were taking the class to pick a gender role and stick with it until after the class ended and they were good enough to be able to handle both roles... even though, unlike some MWSD clubs, we did teach \"all-position\" dancing so that there were only about 3 actually gendered calls (allemande-left your corner, star-thru, and slide-thru being the ones that come to mind).\n<br>\n<br>\nRegarding the \"pouncing\": I agree this is a problem. I think this has been discussed in Jeff's previous posts about the book-ahead culture. It is unfortunately self-propagating: the more pouncing, the more people feel the need to pounce (or book ahead) if they want to dance with popular dancers. Connecting back to gender-free, as a new and somewhat shy dancer, I actually danced same gender 1 out of 3 dances or so because I wasn't pouncing, and didn't like booking ahead. (though I did notice that when going to a strange dance, dancing the \"wrong\" gender role competently seemed to serve as a signal of being a good dancer, making it easier to get good partners later).\n<br>\n<br>\nRegarding the \"rule\" about accepting dances or sitting out: my impression was that this \"rule\" was originally designed to make for a more inclusive dance community, to avoid the problem in some dance communities of a snob culture where if you aren't good, you can't get a partner. Unfortunately, this rule is abused: I have heard too many (mostly female) complaints about being targeted by creepy dancers (or, in some cases, partners who push or twist too much during dancing, and therefore aren't physically safe). I think perhaps it is time to think about a new way to encourage inclusiveness without making people dance with people they don't want to dance with.\n<br>\n<br>\n\u00a0</p>", 1342651977], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1342663460682", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111675838261170541573\">Marcus</a>\n\u00a0\"Unfortunately, this rule is abused: I have heard too many (mostly female) complaints about being targeted by creepy dancers (or, in some cases, partners who push or twist too much during dancing, and therefore aren't physically safe).\"\n<br>\n<br>\nI think in those situations it is completely fine to say \"no\" and then dance with someone else.</p>", 1342663460]]
