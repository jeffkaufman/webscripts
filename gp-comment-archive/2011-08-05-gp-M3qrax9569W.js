I'd be really interested to know how much traction this idea has, which demographics are most receptive to it, how they're best approached, etc.\n<br>\n<br>\nI wonder if you could get businesses to give discounts/special offers to your whatever-ists? It would lessen the financial sting a little, and make people feel more like they were part of an awesome club than a group of slightly crazy people.</p>", 1312556867], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1312558489480", "<p>@Ben: in the market research vein, you would also care about how much of an impact people from different groups were likely to make.  If market research shows medical students are hard to convince, because their earnings potential is high it may still be worth it to go speak at a medical school.\n<br>\n<br>\nI don't know about convincing businesses to give discounts.  My guess is that time spent talking to businesses and the overhead of some sort of identification card and approval, would be large for low reward.  But this could be tested: pick a few businesses, go talk to them, get a better idea of how easy a sell this is.</p>", 1312558489], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1312563238081", "<p>Targeting organizations through which giving is done sounds like it has a lot of potential.
