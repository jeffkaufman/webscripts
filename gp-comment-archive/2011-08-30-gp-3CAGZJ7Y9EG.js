You currently have an angular velocity pointing straight right. The angular velocity of the push you're giving is into the screen. That would suggest that the combined angular velocity would be into the screen angled to the right and thus the rod would not stay in the plane of the screen as my physical intuition says it would. However, gyroscopes don't follow my physical intuition either, so I'm tempted to not trust it.\n<br>\n<br>\nI would really like to try this at some point and find out which intuition is correct. Think we could set it up somehow? Maybe suspend the rod in a contraption that allows 3 dimensional rotations and then apply the correct forces? Not sure how we would go about that though. The other possibility would be to model the rod as a mesh of points with very strong springs between them and see how they operate. That way we wouldn't have to model rotation, we would get it as part of the result.\n<br>\n<br>\nWikipedia didn't reveal the answer to me directly, but the comment about infinitesimal rotations being commutative hints that my mathematical intuition might be right.\n<br>\n<br>\nLinks:\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_plural_of_axis\">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_plural_of_axis</a></p>", 1314723052], ["Chris", "https://plus.google.com/117346402173047680184", "gp-1314723443635", "<p>Actually, the gyroscope might be the perfect model.
