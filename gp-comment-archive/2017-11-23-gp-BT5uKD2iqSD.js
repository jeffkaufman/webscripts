That's both valuable over time (they focus more and put more energy in) and as a selection criteria at the beginning (people who go \"Maybe?\" at the concept are more likely to walk away).  \n<br>\n<br>\nIn terms of why the employees would choose it, isn't that dependent on what the expectation value of the stock options if the company succeeds/fails?  I think the perception is that if the company succeeds the employee will be rich Rich RICH, and thus that averaged out over possible outcomes the stock options for lower salary trade is enough of a win to make up for the extra risk.  I question (pretty severely) whether or not that evaluation is accurate; my understanding is that stock in startups these days is much more heavily weighted towards VCs than employees in ways that aren't obvious if you're not a company structure lawyer.  And just evaluating the likely payoff (after several rounds of funding) without those games is hard.  But I think it's the common evaluation. </p>", 1511451511], ["Chris", "https://plus.google.com/112938759017605010116", "gp-1511738193017", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/108579573899435547873\">Dan</a>\n made the same point recently:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://danluu.com/startup-options/\">https://danluu.com/startup-options/</a></p>", 1511738193]]
