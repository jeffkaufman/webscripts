In order for the artist to make $1 off me listening to an individual song on Pandora, I'd have to listen to it over 60k times. If I buy a song off iTunes for $1, I'm not going to listen to it even a fraction of that time. Say the artist gets just 1% of that, so they just need to make it to 1c- that's still over 600 plays on Pandora to equal the iTunes revenue, which is an order of magnitude more than anything in my music library has.\n<br>\n<br>\nThen again, since Pandora makes no revenue off of me at all (yay Adblock)...</p>", 1372310195]]
