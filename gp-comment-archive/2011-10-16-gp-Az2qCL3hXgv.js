I agree that giving a sandwich on the street is high-fuzzies and low-impact, but it's also low-effort.

If so, we have more that has to be done than time, money, or effort to do it.  I think the right approach is a kind of triage.  We should help the people we can who are most cost effective to help, and it turns out these are not local people.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you still want to help local people because it makes you feel good, that's fine, but if you're doing it because you really think it's one of the most effective ways to do good, I think you're mistaken.</p>", 1318854348], ["Allison", "https://plus.google.com/103741579182942078941", "gp-1318855584489", "<p>I'm going to keep running with the flooded home example from earlier.

Its not clear to me that figuring out how to spend that time working toward international aid would have been a productive; I would get a trivial amount of money on the street, and there wasn't enough time to organize something bigger.

I didn't really want to do it, but I felt obligation to do so because it was part of a larger church program.  It was easy and obvious.

The problem is the magnitude and duration.  If you help someone with whom you are in direct contact, the feelings are more intense.  Likewise, it usually takes more than a minute to help someone in person, so the feelings last for longer and are easier to remember.\n<br>\n<br>\nI've tried a method to transfer feelings before, though not on charitable acts.  It's worked okay for me in the past.  As an example, say I really love my family.  I think about how much I love them and why.  I think about the quirks they have that make me smile, or even the things that they do that I don't like, but focus on how I love them anyway.  Regardless, I cultivate that love.  Then, when I encounter someone I have a negative reaction to, I can think about those positive feelings, and I end up reacting more positively to that person, and even can appreciate them.\n<br>\n<br>\nI think if we take the time to train ourselves to think about why helping strangers feels good: the smiles on people's faces, the sincere gratitude, or whatever other impact we've seen; then it's easier to feel good about a donation does by imagining its impact, which reinforces the optimal act.  Without backdrop experiences of local charity work, even a minimal set of experiences, this kind of transfer is harder.  In some sense, this exercise would be \"selfish\" since it would be for the purpose of making the donator feel better about their choices, but if it gets more people to donate more regularly, then it's not really selfish at all.\n<br>\n<br>\nSo, lessening the feelings associated with suboptimal charity isn't bad inherently, but I think it's not good to strip someone of all their warm-fuzzy feelings.  It's important to try and replace the feelings with warm-fuzzies from effective charity, even if it's hard to accomplish and results in a net warm-fuzzies loss.  To really convince a lot of people about a cause for the long haul requires an emotional component.</p>", 1318943790]]
