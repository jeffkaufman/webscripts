A few comments. \n<br>\nI too am slightly colorblind, but the only trouble I have is what I will call \u201clight pink\u201d.  I can see a strong pink and any strong shade of red (or any other color).  I think most people who have some color impairment are like me, so if you use strong colors, you should be able to get information to a big segment of the \u2018color-blind\u2019 population. \n<br>\nI agree that the color-change cue would need to come a few beats before the change in the dance motion.  After all, that is what the caller does.  You could probably have a lot of fun in how you transitioned from one color to the next (fade, flash sequentially, flash back and forth\u2026  And if you were doing it live, you could even play with it, the way that a nightclub DJ sometimes plays with musical transitions).  And spinning off on a tangent here, you could probably come up with a way that the transition pattern itself carried information of some kind \u2013 fade means one thing, flash means another \u2013 and develop an entire semantic rule set.  But I digress\u2026\n<br>\nIt would be very interesting to test your theory of whether there are more differentiable colors that there are contra moves.  As a caller, you know that once people begin picking up the pattern, your cues contain less information (e.g. \u2018Hey\u2019, rather than \u2018Full hey for four\u2019; or \u2018Gents\u2019 in place of \u2018Gents allemande left once and a half\u2019).  You could probably combine some moves \u2013 for example, just one color for \u2018balance and swing\u2019 rather than needing one for \u2018balance\u2019 and one for \u2018swing\u2019. \n<br>\nTo fully test whether people could dance based on color cues alone, you could get the dance going with color cues, then fade the melody out to just a metronomic drumbeat, and see if people continue or start breaking down.  On some dances, people might keep going until they came to the end effects.  \n<br>\nGiven that most dancers are cueing off the beat of the music, you might end up not so much using color as a cue, but as an enhancement to the experience.  I sometimes find random lighting to be slightly distracting, so maybe this idea would be an improvement.  \n<br>\nThe only way to know is to try it.

I know of a good opportunity to run such an experiment.  Arisia is in the process of booking Double Apex to play a techno contra on 1/13/12.  We will have a large number of color controllable lights in that room, which are controlled from a central lighting board or computer.  If you or someone is willing to work with the lighting designer to either manually control the lights or implement software to control them, I can make that happen (I'm technical director of Arisia 2012.)\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile people can distinguish 1000's of colors when comparing them side by side in static conditions, I believe 8-10 colors is the most than can be distinguished reliably when flashed in the context of a dance.  I suggest having a background illumination that is neutrally colored and fairly dim.  The \"calling\" lights can be flashed much brighter and could include white as one of the colors.  I think the amount of information conveyed could be increased by flashing two colors, though more than that is probably too complicated for people to track.  Furthermore, similar pairs should probably be avoided as being too ambiguous, for example, red/orange &amp; fuchsia/orange.  Summing up the single and double color flashes, gives about 40 - 50 combinations which should cover all common calls and even some distinctions such as men/women allemande, or circle left/right.  A few colors should be reserved which will not be used universally, but will signal one or more uncommon and distinctive figures in a dance such as give &amp; take, mad robin, or ricochet.  In other words, red/white will mean give &amp; take in one dance, but mad robin in another.  To accommodate more than two rare figures in a dance, several combinations should be reserved for such use.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt will probably help to give the light signal during the walk through, but I suggest it will also help to have the background light brighter for the walk through than the dance itself.</p>", 1312758396], ["b", "https://plus.google.com/109680641548243670506", "gp-1312758698541", "<p>@Peter- the majority of the 'color blind' population can still discriminate a decent variety of colors, so as long as we're careful not to have too many subtle gradations, most of us should be able to muddle through, especially if this is a as a supplement to verbal calling rather than a replacement.</p>", 1312758698], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1312802076444", "<p>@Peter: trying this at arisia sounds interesting.
