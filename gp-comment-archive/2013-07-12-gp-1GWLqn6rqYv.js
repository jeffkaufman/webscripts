The one further technical challenge is coming up with cars that can run at 125 mph (NE Regional trains do), which will also drive up your maintenance costs.  There is usually a car's worth of space left on Regional trains at Stamford, which is otherwise a pretty typical Metro-North station.\n<br>\n<br>\nOther thoughts: most NE corridor Amtrak (no c!) trains I've been on have been pretty full, which suggests their pricing is \"right\".  Bus routes that aren't very specifically Boston to New York direct are irritatingly expensive (Greyhound to White Plains is priced much more like Amtrak than Fung Wah).  Amtrak Acela and long-distance routes are priced to compete with air travel; if you don't mind it taking a day Boston to Chicago is cheaper on the Lake Shore Limited than on Southwest (haven't checked recently).\n<br>\n<br>\nWhat we really need is the Swiss model: SBB is actually something like four companies.  One owns the infrastructure and sells timetable slots, and takes massive government subsidies.  SBB Cargo and SBB Passenger both buy timetable slots, but on their own are profitable.  If you wanted to start a private passenger service, it'd be under the same terms as the government-run companies.</p>", 1373654853], ["Jeff", "https://plus.google.com/103925107321093261801", "gp-1373658575161", "<p>From\u00a0\n<a href=\"http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/271/180/Private_Car_Tariff.pdf\">http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/271/180/Private_Car_Tariff.pdf</a>\n it appears that there's a minimum $1k charge per movement.
