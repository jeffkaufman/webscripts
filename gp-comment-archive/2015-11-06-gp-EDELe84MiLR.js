The American League (baseball) was founded in 1901 and the first World Series was 1903. The Boston Bruins were not founded until 1924, after Boston had 5 Major League Baseball World Series championships. The Celtics were founded in 1946, and joined the NBA in 1949. The Patriots were founded in 1960, and the first Superbowl was for the 1966 season.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing is that there are many more teams in each league now than there were before, so there are more possible winners now.\n<br>\n<br>\nThird, as playoffs have expanded, there is much more randomness now in which team wins the championship. In baseball, for example, it used to be that the team with the best record from American League would play the team with the best record from the National League in the World Series. That's a pretty large sample size to determine the Series participants. Then they added a League Championship Series round. Then they added the Division Series Round. Then they added a one game Wild Card Round. That's 10 teams in the playoffs, some of which possibly could have only won a handful more than they've lost. That's more teams in the playoffs now than there were in the entire American League for the first World Series years. Those teams are playing short series, so a very small sample size, thus the winner is determined much more randomly.</p>", 1446788286], ["Daniel", "https://plus.google.com/106627634005073412802", "gp-1446862836247", "<p>Were these all the teams that were represented?
