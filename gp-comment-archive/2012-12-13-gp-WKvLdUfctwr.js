If you take out a student loan, they can't repossess your education.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you could declare bankruptcy to get out from under student debt, you could save the money you would have been paying toward those loans to buy a reasonably nice car with cash within just two to four years, depending on the car and the loan terms. Depending on where you live, you could probably do the same thing (after a much longer saving period, obviously- but not necessarily longer than the length of the student loan) with a small house. Point being, the loss of your credit wouldn't serve as much of a consequence. That would truly be a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>", 1355461630], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1355462895321", "<p>I love how you can donate to them with your credit card. </p>", 1355462895], ["Josh", "https://plus.google.com/118273920476267337216", "gp-1355463660224", "<p>The notion that debt is evil seems to me to fundamentally misunderstand the idea of saving and investing. (The converse of which is borrowing: If I have money that I'm not using right now (because I'm saving it for later), and you need money that you don't have right now, I can loan you my money, and when you pay it back (with a little interest), we're both better off.)\n<br>\n<br>\nBorrowing money you can't pay back is a bad idea. (Much like lending money to people who won't pay it back.) And sometimes you think you can, and you turn out to be wrong, and that sucks. But it's no more evil than borrowing a hammer that you then go on to lose, or forget to return before your neighbor moves away, or any other sort of lending. (We don't usually explicitly ask or offer interest on non-monetary loans, although in fact we do often kick some in, if the value of the thing is high enough -- if you lend me your car for a week while you're out of town, I'll probably do something nice for you when\u00a0 you get back, like have it cleaned, or take you out to dinner, or bake you some cookies, or whatever.)\n<br>\n<br>\n(And none of that is fundamentally any different than if you loan me $100 so that I can buy the ingredients to make cookies, which I sell for $110, and give you a plateful to thank you.

As a specific example, think what happens when someone puts money in a retirement account that then gets loaned out to a college student. The lender gets the interest money later, when they retire, which fits their plans just fine. The college kid gets an education now, and will make more money later as a result.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis said, I suspect the point being made, a little bit over-aggressively, is that \nindividuals\n should be\u00a0leery\u00a0of debt.
