If you have elastic armbands, say, it's fairly easy to quickly take them off and pocket them between dances. It just doesn't work with the flagging tape option. Of course, getting elastic armbands for one event doesn't make a ton of sense.</p>", 1362500222], ["Allison", "https://plus.google.com/109502185221418876252", "gp-1362500787108", "<p>I was skeptical of this technology at first, but now I have danced for awhile in the SF gender free contra scene, and the armbands don't seem like much of an encumbrance to advanced dancers role-switching during a dance. People who plan to switch usually don't have either partner wear an armband, and this works fine. (But you might want to alert your usual suspects for mid-dance switching that this is the preferred method; I have danced with a partner who wanted to switch and also wanted to have the \"band\" wear a band, and that was awkward and I think made it harder for people dancing with us.)\n<br>\n<br>\nIn fact, I generally don't wear an armband no matter what role I am dancing and how long I plan to keep it, and this also works fine. Occasionally a partner will insist, usually an experienced dancer who is concerned for new dancers, and I will wear one to avoid the argument, but mostly new dancers do just dance with who comes to them.

I was surprised and impressed by the dances he managed to call without role terms at all, but wouldn't recommend the style unless your caller is enthusiastic about it. It required extra planning on his part and extra memory from the dancers (for instance, in a couple of dances, he gave us a \"home side\" and used that in calls: \"give and take to your home side\"), and also relied on us swinging in a consistent manner on our own (at least for neighbor swings) which was safe in this experienced crowd but wouldn't be everywhere.

Also, I think, this is actually preferable. Especially because people do not always wear armbands in a consistent manner; inexperienced dancers do not necessarily have the time and attention to spend looking for an armband that may have slipped down to a wrist or be partially covered by a sleeve.

It also aggravates problems associated with experienced dancers who don't know each other, and dancers who think they're more experienced than they are. Concretely, I've from time to time had the experience of going to a new dance (as a reasonably experienced, albeit non-expert dancer) and ending up dancing the 'lady' role while presenting as male, and having had people I meet in the dance pause for a moment to try to decide if they're supposed to be correcting me - not a huge deal, but it is annoying and it tends to screw up the flow, and there are a number of other scenarios like this. It's true that a missing armband is never unambiguous proof of a parity error, but it still seems like maximizing available parity information can only be an improvement.\n<br>\n<br>\nYes, if you're really switching roles so often that armband handoffs aren't viable, of course you just take them off an figure everybody else will deal.
