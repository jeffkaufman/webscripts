If I have a right not to show up in a Google search, wouldn't that imply that no site with a decent amount of traffic could even mention me in any way without getting my consent? That certainly isn't how we've treated other media in the past (suppose newspapers had been subjected to such a restriction).\n<br>\n<br>\nI think what's more likely to happen is that we'll adapt to the new lack of forgetfulness by becoming generally more forgiving. I'm thinking of this in terms of political campaigns- we will (hopefully) get to the point where everyone expects that every candidate has said some stuff in his past that doesn't make sense or was foolish. Instead, what will matter is the frequency or\u00a0recency. At least, if that doesn't happen, it will become impossible to ever elect anyone.</p>", 1340242863], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1340244393996", "<p>\"If I have a right not to show up in a Google search, wouldn't that imply that no site with a decent amount of traffic could even mention me in any way without getting my consent?\"\n<br>\n<br>\nIt could be that this would be a restriction on search and aggregation instead of on publishing.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"becoming generally more forgiving\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThat would be reasonable, but it may assume too much of us.</p>", 1340244393], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1340244438797", "<p>\"That would be reasonable, but it may assume too much of us.\" I know =(</p>", 1340244438], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1342755860048", "<p><a href=\"http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2249\">http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2249</a></p>", 1342755860]]
