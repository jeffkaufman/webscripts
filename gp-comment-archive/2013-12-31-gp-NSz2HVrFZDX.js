I've yet to see a bottle nipple that has a multi-duct structure like a real breast, which I imagine would have flow properties more like the real thing. The breast has an active immune system; I don't know how you would clean out a bottle nipple that didn't have a single large hollow area. Maybe soaking plus steaming?</p>", 1388509669], ["Mad", "https://plus.google.com/100533872344198336746", "gp-1388669219008", "<p>Also a problem: nipples have a lot of variation. Solution: use a nipple shield to standardize nipple shape. Pros: shape optimized to stimulate infant's sucking behavior and can match bottle nipple shape. Cons: infant may not learn to accept unshielded nipple, and now you have an additional fiddly thing to keep track of and wash.
