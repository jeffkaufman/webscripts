That is, the dance itself takes the follow role, while the larger society takes the lead.\n<br>\n<br>\nMore generally, a dance gives people a space to play with their interactions with people of the same and the opposite gender. The nature of any form of play is that it is a precursor to encounters in real life that will occur later. As such, the play that people want to participate in tends to be somewhat close to what they expect to be dealing with in a later non-play environment.\n<br>\n<br>\nOne thing I will say is that contra dancing makes it harder than some forms to break out and experiment with role swapping. The trouble is that a guy dancing the follow role will end up dancing with a LOT of guys. Moreover, those guys will have little experience in dancing with other guys, so it tends to be one ugly encounter after another, all the way up the line. All this adds up to mean you have to make a larger bundle of changes all at once.</p>", 1363272847], ["Robert", "https://plus.google.com/117732328885787456164", "gp-1363285398504", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111102660583646544610\">Lex</a>\n : \"The trouble is that a guy dancing the follow role will end up dancing with a LOT of guys.

At the two places that I most regularly dance (apart from my \"home\" dance, which is gender-free), namely BIDA in Cambridge and the Scout House in Concord, MA, the regular guys have gotten pretty used to dancing with other guys, and I find that \"ugly encounters\" are rare and getting rarer. (I'm assuming that the guys who try to make me twirl on every courtesy turn do the same thing to women.) This may be less true in other regions, but these are places where I think it would be a good idea to \nencourage\n dancers that are so inclined to role-swap, which will help educate the others.</p>", 1363285398]]
