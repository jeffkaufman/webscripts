I know they'll also open up cheeses if you ask about, for example, the difference between different parmesans.  We've also had samples of produce offered at Whole Foods and they seem pretty chill about allowing small samples from the bulk aisle (nuts, granola, etc.) in addition to the ~4-5 cheese samples they always have out.  The bakery we go to always has samples of at least three different breads already cut and they'll cut you a sample of whatever you ask for in addition.  Some of the vendors at the Davis farmer's market will do samples, too.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are a couple of places we shop where sampling can't happen practically and there we tend to rely on expert opinion -- we ask the owner of the fish market what's good that day, we ask the wine guy at Dave's Fresh Paste for recommendations within certain parameters, etc.</p>", 1329446911], ["Todd", "https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066", "gp-1329448172020", "<p>It seems like there should be a market opportunity here for a company that can find a way to more reliably/accurately signal quality.
