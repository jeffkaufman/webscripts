Each butterfly lives only a few months as a flying adult, which means each one makes only about 1/4th of the migration.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThat's not quite correct. It's correct for the journey north in spring, but the fourth generation of adult monarchs does actually fly all the way to Mexico to overwinter; these individuals live longer than the earlier generations. See\u00a0\n<a href=\"http://www.monarch-butterfly.com/index.html#Life-Cycle\">http://www.monarch-butterfly.com/index.html#Life-Cycle</a>\n for example.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are several reasons for the decline in monarchs; the milkweed connection isn't the only one; other factors include habitat destruction and climate change in the overwintering region.\n<br>\n<br>\nOne solution may be to optimize farmlands for multiple uses, which has in fact been a standard practice among many farmers in the past (e.g., planting \"living hedges\" that separate fields while providing food and shelter for wildlife). See\u00a0\n<a href=\"http://grist.org/food/of-monarchs-and-milkweeds-how-one-species-pest-is-anothers-repast/\">http://grist.org/food/of-monarchs-and-milkweeds-how-one-species-pest-is-anothers-repast/</a>\n for a few thoughts on this in relation to monarchs.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe challenge is in providing an incentive to farmers to protect milkweed (or to provide an incentive to private landowners to plant it). In the monarchs' overwintering grounds, tourism provides an incentive for villagers to support reforestation efforts (see\u00a0\n<a href=\"http://www.monarchbutterflyfund.org/conservation-strategy\">http://www.monarchbutterflyfund.org/conservation-strategy</a>\n). But it's harder to monetize monarchs and milkweed for farmers in North America. One approach might be a tax on soybeans that is used to fund milkweed plantation projects.</p>", 1385816408], ["David&nbsp;Chudzicki", "https://plus.google.com/106120852580068301475", "gp-1385843740059", "<p>Brad, it seems like you've jumped into potential solutions without addressing Jeff's core question about tradeoffs.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd to Jeff-- whether or not the benefits outweigh the costs, it's worth noting that the costs and benefits are experienced by different parties. There could be any number of reasons that doesn't matter (maybe the costs are tiny compared to the benefits, maybe you're happy trading off some good to some for more good to others, etc.) -- but also it could matter, depending on your sense of fairness, your sense of what the costs/benefits really are, etc.</p>", 1385843740], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1385847926825", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302\">Brad</a>\n\u00a0\"other factors include habitat destruction and climate change in the overwintering region\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThis paper argues that decreasing milkweed is the main cause:\u00a0\n<a href=\"http://www.amigaproject.eu/web/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Monarch-and-HT-crops-20122.pdf\">http://www.amigaproject.eu/web/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Monarch-and-HT-crops-20122.pdf</a></p>", 1385847926]]
