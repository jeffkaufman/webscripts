It's similar to reading an article versus listening to a speech. Sure, if you are doing it for enjoyment, listening can be better. If you are trying to absorb the information content, though, then the written form is much better.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor contra music, and other catchy, regular tunes, you might want to look into \"abc\" notation. The AOB keeps all of its files in a library of abc files, and we print them out to sheet music on demand. Which we then struggle to not pay too much attention to.</p>", 1398979153], ["Lex", "https://plus.google.com/111102660583646544610", "gp-1398979735532", "<p>Another little thing you might consider is to pick a chord and write the name of it over each measure.
