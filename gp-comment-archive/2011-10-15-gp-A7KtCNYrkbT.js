It's because the human brain doesn't work that way.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere's not really a way to compare the happiness or suffering or \"quality-of-life\" between two people from two different cultures. Take Kenya for example. Infant mortality is high, productivity is low, and everyone is corrupt. I just finished a memoir of an American who spent several decades there, and he talked about the local Masai tribesman whose job was to slaughter cows for meat for a particular tourist village. The Masai's culture is rather permeated with cows, so this guy knows what a healthy cow looks like. The tribesman was jovial, friendly, and blithely corrupt, and poisoned half the tourist village when he accepted a cow for slaughter who had died on the way.\n<br>\n<br>\nInstead of calling for his head afterward, the workers (who were poisoned by this guy! Poisoned! They could have died!) were merely annoyed for a day and then promptly forgot about it. If that happened here, things would be different, and it has everything to do with culture. There's a word in Swahili, 'dunia', that basically means \"that's the world, that's how it is,\" and it basically gets to the heart of the issue: if someone gets poisoned, and they shrug it off as just the way of the world, are they really suffering? If a third of your children die before adolescence, but so does everyone else's, and you expect it, is each death just as tragic? If you are a rich, well-off American, but the most important person in your life dies from cancer, do you suffer less because of your other material comforts?\n<br>\n<br>\nI would argue that it depends entirely on your cultural context, which is why it makes some sense to help those who are suffering nearby rather than those who suffer far away: you can assess their suffering by understanding their cultural context, in a way you cannot do the same for someone in China. Only in the most severe of cases, such as famine, genocide, or systematic oppression, can we tell without having to go there that someone is really suffering. Economic shortcomings, general health, education... these are things that are much harder to judge.</p>", 1318691253], ["Allison", "https://plus.google.com/103741579182942078941", "gp-1318694343177", "<p>I don't think we have to choose between giving locally and giving abroad.  It seems that local/community-based focus/service has to do with being educated (time) and involved (time + effort), with maybe a little bit of money sprinkled in.  In the summer, it's actually cheaper for me to buy local produce.  I can vote, play an activist's role, and help others physically.  When there was flooding out here, people's entire homes were destroyed, and some of those people had no friends or family to help and no insurance.  They're alive, but to quote Game of Thrones, \"see what life is worth when everything else is stripped away.\"  Ignoring local needs completely seems heartless.\n<br>\n<br>\nOn the flip side, it's good to regularly donate money to high-need areas abroad--it's the most efficient way to help those people in the long run.  Understanding a totally new culture would take a lot of time and effort, and most people would be unhappy doing so unless they were really committed, thus giving money makes sense.  Ignoring suffering children seems heartless.\n<br>\n<br>\nI think another aspect of this is each individual's priorities.  Say I have a certain amount of time, effort, and money to spend helping other people.  My priorities would put most of my time and effort locally and most of my money abroad.  (And I still don't think time/effort is exchangeable with money.)  But I enjoy that balance.  Jeff, you seem to enjoy a strict maximization of life per dollar.  Other people enjoy focusing their efforts only locally.  Still more enjoy not helping anyone at all.  In the end, we may not agree with each other, but I'm glad that the discussion is out there and that the focus is on how to help people and not the million other ways to use money and spend time/effort.</p>", 1318694343], ["David&nbsp;German", "https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481", "gp-1318695845783", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/100936518160252317727\">Alex</a>\n I think disease is another case where it's pretty obvious that someone is suffering.

I think I'd enjoy more spending money on myself and people I know. Travelling internationally, perhaps taking a shot at playing music or calling professionally. But I think it would be wrong of me to do this.

The confounding thing is, different charitable options have different amounts of these benefits. Giving money (or a sandwich) to someone on the street asking for food gives quite a bit of the former, but much less of the latter. Donating to an international charity has very little of the former, but a lot of the latter. Both are important. If the people around you have lost their homes, you will probably be compelled to help them. This is human. We help those around us. We need to do this in order not to deplete our inner warmth.  The tricky thing is, doing things for the warm fuzzy feeling is doing things for yourself. It's a very positive kind of selfishness. Real altruism is doing what does the most good, regardless of how it makes you feel.  And we need this too.  We need a lot of it.</p>", 1318735825], ["Julia", "https://plus.google.com/102487727783123805341", "gp-1318742015340", "<p>In the church, or at least in my church, they talk a lot about the difference between justice and charity.  They're both necessary and not the same.  They always tell some story about bodies in a river which explains the whole thing.  I don't know, but maybe it's easier to do justice work locally?  I suppose you'd know more about the local system than you would about some far-away one, and so you'd be more successful at changing it.</p>", 1318742015]]
