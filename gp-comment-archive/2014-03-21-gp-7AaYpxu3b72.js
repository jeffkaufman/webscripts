A standard driveway is only 10 feet wide, while a standard parallel parking spot is 20 feet long. So a driveway actually takes up only half the street space of a parked car. If every house on the street has a driveway, you can fit significantly more cars - which is important when a lot of buildings in Boston are multifamily.\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\nA driveway also allows you to dodge certain parking restrictions - for instance, you can't park within ten feet of a hydrant or twenty feet of an intersection, but there is no issue with your driveway being within these restrictions. (I realize that many people simply disregard these laws anyway). It also provides parking that is viable 24/7/365, whereas a lot of street parking will have limitations for street cleaning or snow removal.\u00a0</p>", 1395414131], ["Chris", "https://plus.google.com/107571733464918568808", "gp-1395416586648", "<p>Re: permit parking, are there cities that do \"you and only you have the spot in front of your front door\" or is it always zone based?</p>", 1395416586], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1395421330172", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109686970531250960199\">Hassan</a>\n\u00a0\"A standard driveway is only 10 feet wide, while a standard parallel parking spot is 20 feet long.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nPeople leave space around driveways because it would be hard to get out if people parked right up to the edge. \u00a0Looking at satellite views of parallel parked cars the gaps left for driveways measure only about a foot less than the ~18ft cars take:\u00a0\n<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/driveway-inefficiency-car-sized-hole.jpg\">http://www.jefftk.com/driveway-inefficiency-car-sized-hole.jpg</a></p>", 1395421330], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1395421364531", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107571733464918568808\">Chris</a>\n\u00a0\"you and only you have the spot in front of your front door\"?\n<br>\n<br>\nI haven't been able to find any that work like this, but let me know if you do!</p>", 1395421364], ["Will", "https://plus.google.com/115623320734956550423", "gp-1395434043660", "<p>Our city (Ames, IA) makes parking on one side of the street illegal so we don't get any space on the road in front of our house and if our neighbors across the street have their kids over, there's no parking within a few houses of us.</p>", 1395434043], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1395435439164", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115623320734956550423\">Will</a>\n\u00a0If a side of a street has driveways but no parking, then the inefficiency I'm observing doesn't apply to that side of the street.</p>", 1395435439]]
