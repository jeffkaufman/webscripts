As for \"lead\" and \"follow\", I notice that in discussing who's going to do what people often use these terms (\"I'd rather follow\", etc.); as long as people don't take the terms too literally (as some people, especially \"leaders\", sometimes do), it should work.

Also, visual cues to indicate role are actually much more important/useful for experienced dancers to learn the roles of the inexperienced dancers, so we can help them be in the right place.
