Let there be 100 doors instead of 3.  You pick one door and Monty opens 98 other doors.  You can decide whether to stick by your original answer or switch to the door he didn't open.  Obviously you want to switch to that conspicuously closed door.  Of course, if you use this explanation, you then have to convince your listener that Monty opening 98 doors (not just one) is the same problem.  Also the article where Marilyn vos Savant correctly answers this question and then gets condescending mail from math professors around the country is amazing:\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.marilynvossavant.com/articles/gameshow.html\">http://www.marilynvossavant.com/articles/gameshow.html</a></p>", 1324400075]]
