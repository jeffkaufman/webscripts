But that book also makes it clear that these people have very little financial resilience: their strategies work as long as everything goes according to plan. But if someone gets sick, or bad weather wipes out a source of income, they frequently have little or nothing to fall back on.\n<br>\n<br>\nAlso worth noting that while it may be better to receive your income at the beginning of the year than month by month, it requires a lot more discipline to stay within budget that way. There's a lot of convincing research to show that people tend to spend more if they have a big pool of money available, just as they tend to eat more if you give them a big plate of food. For people who have trouble living within their means, rationing may work better because it breaks large quantities into smaller portions.\u00a0</p>", 1377343575], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1377347111981", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302\">Brad</a>\n\u00a0\n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481\">David&nbsp;German</a>\n\u00a0It would be interesting to run a study where you compare \"lump sum at the beginning of the year\" to \"bank card that fills continuously at X cents per hour\" and see which group of people did better. \u00a0I see both the argument that you can use the lump sum more effectively and the argument that it's harder to screw up a continuous stream and it requires less willpower.</p>", 1377347111], ["Brad", "https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302", "gp-1377355371396", "<p>My guess is that it depends on the context in which people live. For example, in the UK and much of Europe, people often get one paycheck per month, so they have to learn to be disciplined about budgeting so they don't run out before the next paycheck. Similarly, poor people in developing countries are highly skilled at making a lump sum of money go a long way. But a person in the U.S. who gets two paychecks per month or who's paid weekly might find it difficult to manage a large lump sum.
