Result: much more standing. Heels hurt for a few days, &amp; the setup is a drag if I'm tired &amp; really want to sit. But overall it definitely beats sitting all day. When I'm being really virtuous I periodically stand on the leg that's weaker than the other one due to an old injury, &amp; do kneebends &amp; things.</p>", 1324334242]]
