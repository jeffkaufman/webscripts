Sorry this is so terse.\n<br>\n<br>\nFirst, the benefits to humanity are a crucial part of the calculation. I don't even believe in \"improving the environment\" except insofar as it comes back around and helps people. The pre-human environment was awful, and I see no reason to want to return to it. People who treat \"anthropogenic\" as another word for \"bad\" seem really off base to me.\n<br>\n<br>\nSecond, the \"environment\" includes more than wildlife and sunshine. It includes all the artificial changes that non-humans make, such as bird nests. It also includes all the artificial changes that humans make, such as running water. When you look at the environment in such a way, you have a very different calculus for what counts as helping or harming the environment.\n<br>\n<br>\nPutting it together, an environment where hardly anyone gets to fly sounds bad to me. It sounds much worse \nfor human beings\n than the world we have now.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, kudos for being willing to make sacrifices for what you believe in. It's nice to see in a world that's so full of instant gratification.</p>", 1447347967], ["Bill", "https://plus.google.com/108760936971088604094", "gp-1447650775446", "<p>Jeff, enjoyed reading your post and wanted to share a couple of thoughts (though I'm sure much of this has already been said on the various comment threads).\u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\n1) First of all, I really liked the format -- more people should get into the habit of quasi-summarizing / rebutting internet comment discussions in this type of way! Would be keen to read more like this.\n<br>\n<br>\n2) B's argument in the final paragraph on finite willpower / ego depletion: I wonder if someone who thinks about minimally-harmful daily luxuries such as hot showers, dairy consumption is actually MORE likely to donate $5 to charity because a daily avoidance of luxury is a daily reminder to be altruistic. So self sacrifice is a net positive. I suppose this argument has already been explored?\n<br>\n<br>\n3) I would be concerned that an EAer who is open to the minimally-harmful daily luxuries is therefore overly caught up in this mental calculus, and that paralyzes their actions. I.e. it would be more willpower depleting for an EAer to run a cost-benefit analysis, rather than always trying to avoid the luxuries and then not minding too much if he/she backslides one day.\n<br>\n<br>\n4) Is there an alternative paradigm for personal choices other than mentally viewing ourselves like little characters from \"The Sims\" who need to have their \"happiness bar\" topped up every now and again by little luxuries? I guess I am maybe getting at an \"fulfilment through asceticism\" argument here...\n<br>\n<br>\n5) I would rather hold up the \"no luxuries, even if they are minimally-harmful\" as an ideal, but it being OK to fall short -- rather than saying \"OK, sometimes it's alright to indulge in a luxury, but you need to decide if the willpower you're saving by not indulging in the luxury is outweighed by the willpower you'd use to do something more effective\". That seems like it'd lead to a lot of tough calls.\n<br>\n<br>\nThanks, enjoy your blog and look forward to reading more. -Bill</p>", 1447650775]]
