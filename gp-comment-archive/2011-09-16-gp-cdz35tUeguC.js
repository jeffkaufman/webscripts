Not that they are perfect.  Nor that they have infinite resources.  But I have seen them go after many types of egregious actions, particularly if someone has made significant money with those actions.  I have seen cases where people were investigated due to bugs in their trading algorithms, and for releasing misleading information to a news \u201csource\u201d (including the news media as well as blogs, message boards, etc). \n<br>\nBut is your question just an academic discussion of whether or not it would be legal?  Because a more important question is whether it would make money.  I have a hard time believing that it would work. \n<br>\nMost securities trading today is conducted by professional money managers and proprietary traders who have multiple, overlapping, redundant sources of information, and who generally don\u2019t follow google search results trends.  There has been a recent move toward using that type of information as input to trading algorithms.  One recent example is a mutual fund that is based on an algorithm that watches and analyzes the volume and sentiment of tweets about various companies.  \n<br>\nSo perhaps, now or in the future, some sort of google statistics are or will be included in a trading system.  But the people who design those systems are pretty smart, pretty thorough, and very aware that there are plenty of people out there who might try to distort the information that they depend on.  \n<br>\nSo if it were to work at all, it would probably only be on a small (low-capitalization, thinly traded) issue, which limits the profit potential.</p>", 1316479487]]
