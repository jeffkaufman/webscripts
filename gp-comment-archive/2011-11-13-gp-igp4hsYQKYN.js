These are things that you could then argue make a marginal difference in terms of moving the system.

There's a lot of weird interconnected stuff regarding the power of utilities, as state-approved local monopolies, to affect government regulatory action vis-a-vis power generation/pricing and vice versa, but the point is that in many areas, the regulatory bodies and utilities are playing with these pricing schemes to see how they work in the market since on the macro level the main barrier in the US towards moving away from coal generation is profitability (intermittent supply is a secondary barrier since we haven't installed enough capacity yet for it to come into play).

Granted, the author chooses a pretty obvious one, but what if the lawyer instead donated his hour to providing legal protection or setup for a charity that pays the 100 people $10 an hour to cleanup the park?  \n<br>\n<br>\nGiven the author's contention, we would have been better off purchasing metal braces and electrolysis for polio patients than we would've been to invest in finding a vaccine.  \n<br>\n<br>\nIt seems that most of his admonitions are directly aimed at short term solutions and patches. The world is not completely known, and for many of these things we cannot know what will be successful.  Trying different things and seeing what works is necessary and in the long run far more beneficial than sticking with the most efficient band-aid RIGHT NOW.\n<br>\n<br>\nI also find it to be idealistically naive when it comes to human nature.  The author may have the mental fortitude to work lots of overtime to donate to starving children and never feel a warm glow, but the vast majority of us are not so empathicly endowed.  We NEED positive feedback to keep making sacrifices of any variety.  Pretending otherwise is a sure and fast way to make sure people try living \"The Good Life(tm)\" for a while, get burnt out fast, and stop doing anything to improve their world because it's too hard and too painful.   I have no hard evidence for this one, but anecdotally, I think environmentalists from the 60's and 70's sort of banged up against this.  They demanded that people completely change their lifestyles, make lots of sacrifices, etc.  As a result, after a good start, people got burned out of environmentalism, and we had 15-20 years where it was half-forgotten.  (the 80's and 90's).  A close relative is a bit of an example.  We went from one extreme ('if it's yellow let is mellow if it's brown flush it down' to save water when I was a kid), to her modern self, who cannot be convinced to bother with CFLs because she doesn't like the lighting conditions or to purchase a prius instead of a van because it will be slightly more difficult to deal with her dogs inside.  She got BURNT OUT on trying too hard to make the right choices; she didn't get enough warm fuzzies.\n<br>\n<br>\nSimilarly, I think it's pretty clear that most lawyers, after spending a few months or a few years working overtime to donate money to people they never see will  simply stop working overtime, stop donating, and go get a house on the beach.</p>", 1321282771], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1321283953437", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113667834513475506190\">Ariel</a>\n I was with you up until your concluding sentence: \"so essentially, it may be the case that the decision of individuals to buy clean power can lead to the community at large being forced to use clean power\".

I know that 'perfect is the enemy of good' and that if I try and always do exactly the right thing I'll stand a good chance of burning out and giving up in frustration.  So I think the path that's most likely to work for most people is to do something simple like give 10% of income to the most effective charity you can find, and then not worry about which eggs to buy or whether to get organic chocolate.  By taking the donation money off the top you can save money elsewhere in your budget, wherever hurts the least.\n<br>\n<br>\n[1] \n<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\">http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/</a></p>", 1321285364], ["Ariel", "https://plus.google.com/113667834513475506190", "gp-1321286074960", "<p>Not exactly.  I skipped over a couple steps there so I'm sorry to be confusing.  Basically, the power market is extremely regulated.  This means that 1) the cost that power generation companies charge utilities for electric power is strongly affected by government subsidies and also that 2) the cost that utilities can then charge consumers for power is set by the government.  This model was developed on a system that uses only power generation methods that can supply a relatively constant load -- coal, NG, and large hydro.  (Hydro can change somewhat with the seasons, but in a normally very predictable way, and NG gas turbines can be ramped up and down quickly, but they do it in response to demand so it fits the utility's needs as well).  All of these generation methods have various subsidy and tax structures associated with them (in terms of what the companies pay for fuel, interest rates on loans they took out for startup capital, taxes they pay, what the utility pays the companies, etc.)  Wind (and solar to the extent it's being installed), being basically new, doesn't have this whole regulatory framework set up yet and, being intermittent sources, how much you can actually rely on them is still sort of up in the air since no one's done the necessary grid overhauls yet to make it not an issue (it's not really clear the technology is there yet to do this -- it's an energy storage problem and it's underdeveloped).  The key bit is that it is routinely the case that regulations singlehandedly determine which generation projects are profitable by setting how much the project costs and how profitable it can be (for example, the state with the most installed wind capacity in the US is Texas, because the Texas state government put subsidies in place for wind installation partially as a boon to farmers in the panhandle who can now rent out their land to generation companies but also for a lot of other complicated political reasons).  How that regulatory framework is going to take shape surrounding these new clean generation methods is something that's the subject of a lot of political (and lobbying) debate because there are a lot of options (traditional subsidies, buy-in tariffs, renewable energy credits, carbon markets...).\n<br>\n<br>\nThe way that individual consumers buying in affects things is that different states are trying different of these models, somewhat motivated by the political will of the people in favor of clean energy.  So it's the case that individuals buying wind power is in some sense a \"vote\" towards wind power, but more than that, the more people use these programs, the more money they bring in and the more data there is on how they work, in a number of ways: a) it's better known what can actually be expected from a wind farm of x MW in terms of real generation capacity, effect on the grid, etc. -- people feel more confident investing in them if their behavior/profitability under x conditions is understood better; b) similarly, it's better known which regulatory conditions lead to better profitability and this encourages their development; c) it's a way for politicians to score political points and if a politician scores political points doing something then other politicians want to do it too.\n<br>\n<br>\nBasically what I mean is that overhauling our (very entrenched) power generation system to be cleaner is something that takes a lot of financial and political work, and that work needs a driving force.  It won't do for people to wait until we have the magic clean generation method that can supply base load capacity at below market price -- that's not going to happen any time soon and we don't have the time to wait for it.  We need to make the clean generation methods we have be profitable using the tools at hand, and the way to get that to happen is to agitate for it and make it easier.  Buying wind power does both of these things in a way that's very accessible to consumers.  It's probably not enough by itself, but it definitely contributes.</p>", 1321286074]]
