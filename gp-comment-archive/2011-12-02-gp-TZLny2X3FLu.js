You'd need to use it with something else.\n<br>\n<br>\nMost of the stuff you listed in your spreadsheet is canned, jarred, or tinned wet food. How about non-perishable dry goods? Rice? Dry beans? Regular peanuts? If you can count on the water, you can soak beans cold, and you could also probably soak rice cold into something edible.

Soaking beans cold can be dangerous because there's a toxin that needs to be killed by heat. [1] It looks like you might be able to choose kinds of beans that don't have that toxin, though. Dry beans aren't as good as peanut butter, because while they're the same cost per gram of protein the peanut butter needs 650 additional calories but the dry beans need 1360.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf soaking rice gets you something edible, that beats all the other calorie sources I was looking at before.
