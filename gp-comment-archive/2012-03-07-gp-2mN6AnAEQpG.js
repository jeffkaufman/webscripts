For Hidden Face of Food, I think it's safe to assume that many of the visitors who go veg did so because of the site (either due to the content on the page itself or because the page spurred further exploration). The reason to think so is that most of the visitors come through ads directed at general teenagers, i.e., almost all of the site's visitors didn't intend to come to learn about animals in factory farms. (The ads leading to the page are pretty generic and don't mention factory farming explicitly.) Because Nick's survey was done within a few months of the participants seeing HFoF, it's mildly unlikely that there would have been other factors having a big influence on the decision to eat less meat in that same time window (except things initially triggered by HFoF itself).</p>", 1331266810], ["Julia", "https://plus.google.com/114588710186521489410", "gp-1331299577201", "<p>The ads don't mention animals or factory farms?

They don't mention not eating meat?\n<br>\n<br>\nIf they do mention anything to do with vegetarianism, then because the clickthrough rate for ads is low and the fraction 'like'ing is low, it's possible that you are getting many people who were already considering vegetarianism.  Your sample stops being 'general teenagers' once you pull them in with something vegetarian related.</p>", 1331299729], ["Brian", "https://plus.google.com/116207869987058429586", "gp-1331356777587", "<p>I've actually never seen the ads myself (though I would like to). Some do mention meat but aren't that explicit. Nick gave a few examples via email: (1) A picture of a singer saying \"Find out why [singer] leaves meat off his plate.\" (2) Picture of an abused dog, saying \"Help stop this abuse.\" (3) A picture from Harry Potter saying \"Worse than Voldemort.\" (Apparently that last one didn't have a good success rate upon clickthrough.)\n<br>\n<br>\nI was surprised that the ads are so misleading, but Nick said they seem to work pretty well, and we want to avoid the situation where we only get clicks from people who already care about factory farming. (Of course, there will always be some bias, except with cases like the Harry Potter ad where you have no idea what it's about.)\n<br>\n<br>\nNick talked about the idea of getting veg artists to do a 15-second intro to the video about why they're veg, which would make the ads much less misleading, but he hasn't gotten a chance to try this yet.\n<br>\n<br>\nBias toward people already considering vegetarianism is partly a problem, but not entirely, because that is a population more likely to be impacted. As long as the survey accurately measures changes based on the video, rather than just whether the respondents are already veg, then the measurement should be okay. (However, it's possible that some people already veg misleadingly reported that they became veg due to the video.)\n<br>\n<br>\nIt would be interesting to see how veg ads do in a forum where people don't have to actively click on the ads. For example, on certain YouTube videos, you can't tell what the ad will be ahead of time. Of course, usually users can still skip past the ads if not interested.</p>", 1331356777]]
