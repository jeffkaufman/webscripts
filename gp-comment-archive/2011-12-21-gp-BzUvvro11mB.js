It is very similar to the one you have, but it has 3 auxes: 1 pre, 1 post, and 1 switchable pre/post.  It might use the same power supply.  It has the power supply connection on the back so you can set it down.  Also, the PFL buttons latch.  I've purchased 4 of them on ebay for about $75 each.  Be careful not to get one without its power supply.  People don't realize how big a deal it is, but just the power supply will probably cost you $60.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt's not that big a deal not to have individually switchable phantom power.  The smallest mixer I've seen with that is the A&amp;H GL2, which is probably 5 times the cost of yours.</p>", 1324498994], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1324499676321", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103618186481362054522\">Peter</a>\n The F1 does sound like it would fix some of my annoyances.\n<br>\n<br>\nIs there a technical reason why per-channel phantom power is hard?
