More recently, I saw some data which suggested that chicken meat actually requires significantly less energy input than eggs do per calorie generated, which suggests that to meet my goal of reducing energy consumption I should preferentially get protein calories from chicken rather than eggs, but I haven't done any research yet to confirm this, and I would also want to consider how the chickens are raised.</p>", 1316460210], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1316462025995", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103775592027106438640\">BDan</a>\n your goal in food selection is to minimize direct harm and energy consumption?</p>", 1316462025], ["BDan", "https://plus.google.com/103775592027106438640", "gp-1316464595539", "<p>Energy consumption first (with a subgoal of reducing land usage), direct harm second.

The problem I see with it is that there isn't really anything on it that is universally good: everything includes a specific location, or catch method, or very specific species or subspecies, whereas most restaurants are going to give a lot less information than that.

They've also not been too terribly upset with me asking, which is surprising, since the same people hate to split a check.  \n<br>\n<br>\nAlso, sometimes it's easy:  was it caught in the gulf?
