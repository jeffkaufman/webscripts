Stabilizing selection explains why cockroaches today look pretty much like fossil cockroaches from millions of years ago: once you have an optimal design that works, there's no need for radical changes to it. Directional selection is responsible for things like new species or new features in existing species (stronger, faster, lighter, etc.). It's fascinating to watch parallels in the tech field, driven by user selection (features and price).</p>", 1377712721], ["Jeremy", "https://plus.google.com/103590581158790876995", "gp-1377732059208", "<p>It occurs to me that the constantly increasing complexity (and corresponding slowdown) of popular websites may continue to fuel consumer interest in faster devices.\u00a0 Also gaming...\u00a0 It does seem that as far as what is happening on your average \"personal computer\"-type device, the gains in performance per dollar/watt in the last 20 years have primarily gone towards better visual effects rather than significant functionality improvements.\u00a0 Video playback is an extreme case/exception though.\n<br>\n<br>\nBecause smartphones are heavily tied to phone service that costs significantly more, at least in the US, any cost pressure on smartphones is likely to be diluted.\u00a0 I suppose it is potentially magnified somewhat by some pricing models/advertising schemes that carriers use, though.</p>", 1377732059]]
