The reason I ask is that I make most of our own bread, not for cost savings but convenience (we use a no-knead recipe that requires about 7 minutes total effort from start to finish, and the result is as good as what you can find in most of the best French bakeries in our town), but I've been wondering what a loaf of home-baked bread costs compared with store- or bakery-bought bread. Our bread cooks at about 475 Fahrenheit for 50 minutes, in a cast-iron dutch oven. It's easy to figure out the cost of ingredients but I'm not sure about the cost of running the oven at that temperature (which also requires 15 minutes of preheating).</p>", 1396869526], ["Brad", "https://plus.google.com/116032343632043704302", "gp-1396870396732", "<p>While these are all small individual costs, if you add them up over 10, 20, 30 years they start looking like larger avoidable costs. And if you wanted to go beyond your own personal expenses you could add in the social cost of carbon related to greenhouse gas emissions from the fuels burned to produce this energy. Also insignificant per use but over the course of decades it adds up.
