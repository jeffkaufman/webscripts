That would be ugly, but \nany\n story that starts with a total market and policy failure is going to be ugly.  I don't at all understand why he's expecting one.  Governments and businesses seem to be taking plenty of action well in advance.\n<br>\n<br>\nFirst, the post-fossil-fuel world is already well under construction.  Modern nuclear plants and offshore wind farms are coming online.  Cost per watt for PVs is plummeting.  Production-scale plants for cellulosic ethanol are under construction, as are demo-scale plants for algae biodiesel.  Electric cars are a viable commercial product.\n<br>\n<br>\nSecond, as he admits, the remaining fossil fuel stocks are actually massive.  We can tap centuries' worth of coal, natural gas, heavy oil, and shale oil with current technology and modest capital expenditure.  As we draw from less convenient sources, prices per watt will certainly increase, but that just helps motivate further progress on renewables and electric infrastructure.</p>", 1320450686], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1320674632951", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481\">David&nbsp;German</a>\n \n<br>\n<br>\n\"waking up one New Year's and discovering it doesn't have enough fossil energy anymore\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThis is a little overstated, but you're right: that's a weak point in the argument, and it's a big one. \n<br>\n<br>\n\"the post-fossil-fuel world is already well under construction\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThe current projects are far short of what we'll need.
