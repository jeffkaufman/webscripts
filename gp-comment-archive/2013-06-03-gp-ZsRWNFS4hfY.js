I commend Jason Trigg, but I briefly worked on Wall St. (2007-08) and found it unpalatable in the long run. I'm relatively tough, but I couldn't have done it for longer.\n<br>\n<br>\n(2) From a broader perspective, I don't think you're ever going to convince a large number of bright young people to enter finance to earn-to-give. I wish there was less emphasis on this route as ideal. I'm glad 80,000 hours is around. I think more money can be generated via solidarity with young, socially-minded, bright people who already plan to enter relatively lucrative professions (CS, law, medicine, entrepreneurship, academia) rather than focusing on finance.\n<br>\n<br>\n(3) I find it personally a bit unfair for the academics in this community to be constantly advocating for the rest of us to earn-to-give while they take a less numerically defined, big-picture approach to altruism. There seems to be less respect in this community for unconventional (i.e., non-income maximizing ) ways to give that are less immediately remunerative but still might be highly contributory in the long run.</p>", 1370448893]]
