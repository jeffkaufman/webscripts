Even with my \"Where's My T\" app, when the buses are infrequent, what I want is a bus that shows up and leaves exactly when it says it does, because that's the only way I can successfully plan trips around the buses.

The problem is that people tend to howl like banshees if you try to take away their closest stop and make them walk an extra two blocks.  For new routes, though, the stops should always be spaced farther apart.\n<br>\n<br>\n@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008\">Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman</a>\n People don't like it when they have to get off the red line because it's running express to Harvard or Alewife, but they do it anyway.  If the buses are bunched early in the route and you wait until the first one reaches the end, a lot of people will take much longer to reach their destinations, and the rest won't get there significantly faster.  Part of the problem may be that there isn't a clear way to deal with fares if buses do this, unlike with subways where people just remain inside the faregates.  (POP would take care of it, or a system that permitted a free transfer to the same route, but neither of those seem particularly likely.)</p>", 1327522731], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1327522807736", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107270646379592003271\">Sean</a>\n \"that's the only way I can successfully plan trips around the buses\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are many ways of using buses, and this is only one of them.
