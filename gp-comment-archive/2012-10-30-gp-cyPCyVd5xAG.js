This is certainly a local phenomenon; callers in Chicago and the Bay Area regularly break up long sets, often specifying which groups of four ought to move to which other set. In Chicago, at least, the dance community is small and the same few people call most dances; the Bay Area seems to have a bigger community, but I haven't been around long enough or paying enough attention to know if the callers here repeat very often.</p>", 1351617624], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1351627113303", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109502185221418876252\">Allison</a>\n\u00a0\"callers in his experience tend not to break up too-long or cramped sets\"\n<br>\n<br>\nIn the Boston area it varies. \u00a0At MIT or BIDA the dancers are cooperative and if the caller asks for another set or for set-evening the dancers generally happily comply. \u00a0At a Scout House Thursday it's quite common to have more than twice as many dancers in the fireplace set as in the far opposite one, but the dancers in the crowded set would ignore any requests from the caller for a few couples to move over. \u00a0A caller might be able to convince them to split into two sets, but even that is hard.\n<br>\n<br>\nI think what's going on is that at the dances where people are happy to listen to the caller the sets have become lopsided for little reason, just by people ending up in different places. \u00a0Or the sets are crowded because no one wants to take the social risk of starting a new line. At the Scout House, however, the dancers have chosen their sets intentionally and are happy with them as they are.</p>", 1351627113]]
