The destruction that occurred in the 20th century should be expected to repeat in the 21st.\n<br>\n<br>\nI don't think there will ever be another Communist revolution or world war, so I'm perfectly willing to accept that kind of \"survivorship bias\" in my estimates.\n<br>\n<br>\n2. The conditions in the US in the 1950-2000 era that caused investors to underestimate equity (and thus drive outsize equity returns) are not repeatable.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn the US, I expect technological progress 2000-2050 to dwarf 1950-2000, and I don't think investors are fully accounting for that. \u00a0Worldwide, I think we're poised to see a billion-plus people enter the consumer/investor middle class in the way that Americans did 1900-1950, and investors aren't fully accounting for that either. \u00a0\n<br>\n<br>\n3. Current bond prices do not reflect an increase in risk aversion.\n<br>\n<br>\nThey barely devote a paragraph to this claim, but IMO it's the least convincing of all. \u00a0I think we're sitting on top of an epic risk-aversion-driven bubble in bonds and bills, partly because of aging populations in North America and Europe, and partly because retail investors are still badly spooked by the 2009 crash, persistently high unemployment, their own household balance sheets, and fiscal uncertainty in Europe. \u00a0If I'm right, then the risk premium for equities is higher than Dimson et. al. think.\n<br>\n<br>\n---\n<br>\n<br>\nAs a long-term investor, I'd rather look at the value companies are actually generating than attempt to divine the reservation premia of other investors. \u00a0This points to a simple approach that I find appealing. \u00a0The P/E on the S&amp;P 500 (April 5 close) is 17.96, so I expect roughly 5.5% real return from US equities going forward. \u00a0</p>", 1365349578]]
