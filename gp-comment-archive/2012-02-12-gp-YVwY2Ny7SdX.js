However, my impression is that, in contrast to Hearts, the bidding process for Bridge increases the size of the hand-space that is interesting, because you can basically adjust the mechanics to better suit (ugh) your hand on a game-by-game basis.\n<br>\n<br>\nSpades, on the other hand, might benefit from this, if your hypothesis is correct, since it has a consistent trump suit. Though it would basically make a blind nil impossible, since you'd have to declare it before passing, and then not only would the person passing to you be able to hose you with high cards, they'd also know what those cards were (which would be really back-breaking for a nil, I'd think). Then again, blind nils are basically just a Hail Mary anyway, so I don't know that it would be a great loss.</p>", 1329149113], ["Jeff&nbsp;Kaufman", "https://plus.google.com/103013777355236494008", "gp-1329149542668", "<p>@<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112947709146257842066\">Todd</a>\n You're right that the bidding process makes more Bridge hands interesting, but there are still more and less interesting hands.

The optimal thing to do from the perspective of fun is to throw in a minimal-points hand and not play out a round fighting over one diamond.  These are in conflict; passing resolves the conflict.</p>", 1329493978]]
