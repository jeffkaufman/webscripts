They should explicitly forbidden for sale to minors, and forbidden from marketing to minors.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThey should definitely be regulated to make sure they contain what they're supposed to. \u00a0Forbidding sale and marketing to minors is also reasonable. \u00a0But I \ndon't\n think they should have the high taxes of cigarettes. \u00a0E-cigarettes are currently much cheaper than regular cigarettes, and lower taxes are a lot of this. \u00a0Undermining the cost incentive to switch to something much healthier sounds really bad.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"if you want to harness some of the possible health benefits for smokers, then set up a program where smokers with a history of smoking (either receipts from past cigarette sales or medical history from doctor) can apply for a refund of the tax portion of the cost of e-cigarettes (up to some cap).
