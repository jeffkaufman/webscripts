Whoops!\n<br>\n<br>\nOn holding periods of less than one year, I think Option 2 is strictly more tax advantageous than Option 1.  If the investment appreciates, they're equivalent: you deduct the cost basis, and the charity gets the gain.  If the investment depreciates, under Option 2 you still deduct the entire cost basis, whereas under Option 1 you only deduct the reduced value.  Option 1 will let you capture some benefit from the loss, either netted against other capital gains, or deducted against ordinary income over several years subject to the $3k annual limit, but neither of those is as good as a straight-up deduction.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis effect is probably less important than the PayPal 3%, especially if you don't plan to realize unrelated LTCG.\n<br>\n<br>\nI recommend the Schwab DAF if you don't already have one.  The paperwork for the Vanguard one is annoying.</p>", 1525401763], ["David&nbsp;German", "https://plus.google.com/111229345142780712481", "gp-1525436575370", "<p>Also, I'm not sure I understand your original post.
