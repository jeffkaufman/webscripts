Caller EQ is definitely important, but that's also something a band that runs sound can handle.  Caller level relative to the band is often something that the band can handle by having one of the musicians go out there, but band levels relative to each other don't work as well that way.</p>", 1314374130], ["Danner", "https://plus.google.com/114987071963782993407", "gp-1314387014233", "<p>A decent intro to working a live board. I try to locate both the loudest and quietest piece in the band, sometimes is is better to turn down the loudest, rather than always turn something up, killing dancer's ears. Messing with treble and bass is above the scope of this article, but understanding what the band members sounds like unamplified really helps you get them defined in the speakers the way you want them.

Typically the sound will be quite different in a quiet, empty hall during pre-dance sound checks, versus a hall full of lively dancing bodies.  Aside from talking and stamping and so forth, those bodies are absorbing sound instead of letting it bounce off the floors and walls.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe best we can do pre-dance is try to achieve a reasonable balance, get the monitors right, and then be prepared to tweak during the first couple of dances.  Typically, the band will want the monitors turned up because suddenly they can't hear themselves or their colleagues, the dancers can't hear the caller, etc.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt helps to have all the channels labeled in advance; experienced sound people bring paper tape and markers and make sure the mikes are properly tagged with the channel #, and the mixer is properly labeled for each player/instrument.</p>", 1314889015], ["John", "https://plus.google.com/100633726263571579985", "gp-1314890094238", "<p>Labeling the channels is a good idea.
