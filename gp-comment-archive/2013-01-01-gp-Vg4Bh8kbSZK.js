I sort of feel like if I met a guy who I was really attracted to, I'd be as much willing to go for it as if I met a woman who I was really attracted to; but in practice, it's never come up, so it's easy to speculate. :^)\n<br>\n<br>\nIn any case, insofar as our preferences are flexible, I took your earlier point to be that we're more willing to have strong gender prefences because those preferences don't limit our options much. My point is that if we're evaluating how our preferences will limit our options, and picking our preferences accordingly -- again, very unclear whether/how much we can actually do this -- then \"other people's preferences\" seems like a factor we ought to consider. If I'm looking for a job that will make me happy, I have to consider what kind of work I''m unwilling to do, but I also have to consider what kind of people will hire me.

We need not worry about treating our gender preferences as non-absolute because we \naren't\n forced to choose between a small set of options- we can just keep looking. It's also a response to Jeff's question about whether we should stop treating gender preference as special.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn terms of simple optimization, obviously being more flexible would present more options, but it would also decrease your happiness with your choice. I'd guess that, if you hold preferences as static, people probably already optimize pretty well (the stronger your preferences, the less willing you should be to compromise on them, and many people have very strong gender preferences).</p>", 1357187427], ["Allison", "https://plus.google.com/109502185221418876252", "gp-1357198816995", "<p>To add to Laura Keeler's point on Facebook, even when sexual orientation as such enters the Western consciousness in the late 1800s/ early 1900s, it is not really what we think of as sexual orientation now. For instance, the word \"homosexual\" is used for awhile more or less synonymously with \"invert\", which refers to someone who exhibits characteristics of the opposite sex. So if an effeminate guy and a masculine guy have a sexual encounter, you might seem them (and others) identifying the effeminate guy as homosexual, but not the masculine one. This goes on through about the 1930s or 40s to some degree; I'm currently reading a nonfiction book about lesbian bars in Buffalo in the 40s and 50s, and some of the narrators say things like \"a lesbian and her girlfriend\", always meaning that the lesbian is the butch.</p>", 1357198816]]
