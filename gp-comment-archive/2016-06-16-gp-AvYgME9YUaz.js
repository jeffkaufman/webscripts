If everybody makes a certain amount, then sellers of necessities (like food) can raise prices, forcing a UBI to increase to match, leading to such things increasing far faster than inflation. Like financial aid for college: if the government wants to make sure enough aid is available that it\u2019s relatively easy to send kids to college, colleges can raise prices; in fact tuition has been vastly outstripping inflation in recent years (although I am not sure if this is actually caused by financial aid; that sounds difficult to test).\n<br>\n<br>\nIn other words, a UBI only works if food, water, and shelter prices don\u2019t rise to match, which they would.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the guaranteed income is not a basic income this problem partially goes away, at the cost of not actually solving poverty-related problems.</p>", 1467189344]]
